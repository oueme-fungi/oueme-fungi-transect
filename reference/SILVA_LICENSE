SILVA Terms of Use/License Information

The  SILVA  database  content  offered  at  www.arb-silva.de  (including
results of  all data analysis  services) can  be freely browsed  and the
corresponding information deployed by  all users, independent from their
status (academic  or non-academic).  However, in  case of  any DOWNLOAD,
please consider the following terms in detail:

All downloads  are free for  academic/non-commercial users. They  can be
used and modified  without any restrictions. Also  redistribution of the
downloads or  their derivatives  is permitted  but only  as long  as the
SILVA Terms  of Use/License  Information are  made transparent,  e.g. by
linking/referring to this page (see link in the header of your browser).
Academic  users  are  represented  by  universities  and  non-commercial
research institutes such as members of the German Helmholtz Association,
Leibniz Association and Max-Planck Society, as well as US National Labs.

Users  from  NON-ACADEMIC  environments  can also  directly  access  all
downloads including the  results of all data analysis  services but only
for  limited/temporary  use (only  for  test  purposes). All  downloaded
files  have to  be deleted  latest  after 48  hours. Unauthorized  usage
beyond test  purposes is strictly  prohibited. If you are  interested in
unlimited usage of the SILVA  databases/services or parts of them within
a  non-academic/commercial  environment,  please  contact  us  for  more
information  at contact(at)arb-silva.de.  A non-academic  environment is
defined by  a direct  or indirect  commercial interest  in the  data and
includes all industrial research entities.

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on species distributions. These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

We illustrate this process for wetland plant species based upon a matrix of 27 traits and 43 species from across eastern North America. The 43 species were selected to represent the widest range of life history types possible as well as both common species and nationally rare or endangered species. We found three main functional groups: ruderals, matrix and interstitial species, which we subdivide into a total of seven guilds. The growing number of such studies in the literature suggest that this may be an expedient measure for conservation biology and a promising one for predictions.},

We provide a methodology for reclassifying NWI polygons into Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classes to facilitate monitoring wetland functions. We conducted this reclassification using spatial and attribute queries within Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for wetlands in central Oklahoma. Once classified, 149 randomly selected wetlands in four HGM classes (depressional, lacustrine fringe, riverine, and impounded depressional) were field verified. The overall accuracy of the GIS classification was 60\%. Inherent issues with NWI due to attribute accuracy, spatial accuracy, and map age accounted for {$>$}50\% of the misclassified sites in this analysis. The results from this analysis were also used to provide an inventory of wetlands in each HGM class and subclass based on user’s accuracy metrics. Reclassifying NWI polygons into HGM classes can assist with determining the spatial distribution and relative abundance of specific wetland classes which allows for more focused wetland restoration and monitoring efforts. However, the error rate associated with reclassification should be calculated to ensure that incorrect conclusions are not drawn regarding the abundance of HGM wetland classes and their associated functions.},

In total, 150 soil cores were collected from three forests on Mt. Ishizuchi, western Japan, and subjected to bioassays using Pinus densiflora and Betula maximowicziana. Using molecular analyses, we recorded 23 EM fungal species in the assayed propagule banks. Eight species (34.8 \%) were shared across the three sites, which ranged from a warm–temperate evergreen mixed forest to a subalpine conifer forest. The elevation pattern of the assayed propagule banks differed dramatically from that of EM fungi on existing roots along the same gradient, where only a small proportion of EM fungal species (3.5 \%) were shared across sites. The EM fungal species found in the assayed propagule banks included many pioneer fungal species and composition differed significantly from that on existing roots. Furthermore, only 4 of 23 species were shared between the two host species, indicating a strong effect of bioassay host identity in determining the propagule banks of EM fungi. These results imply that the assayed propagule bank is less affected by climate compared to EM fungal communities on existing roots. The dominance of disturbance-dependent fungal species in the assayed propagule banks may result in higher ecosystem resilience to disturbance even in old-growth temperate forests.},

  abstract = {Macrophyte biomass production and species richness were monitored from 1988 through 1991 in four freshwater wetlands constructed on the floodpain of the Des Plaines River, Lake County, Illinois, USA. The wetlands were constructed in 1988 and pumping of river water began in 1989 under two differentd hydrologic regimes: two wetlands received high water inflow (equivalent to 40 cm wk−1 of water depth) and two received low flow (11 cm wk−1). Biomass production showed no relationship to the hydrologic inflows after two years of experimentation, with both the highest and lowest production occuring in low flow wetlands. Rates of primary production increased between 1990 and 1991 under low flow conditions and decreased under high flow conditions, primarily as a result of the initial composition of the plant community. The change from dry conditions in 1988 to flooded conditions in 1989 altered the species composition in each wetland to include almost 100\% wetland-adapted species. Similarity in species composition among the four wetlands diverged from 1988 to 1989 as the plant community adjusted to flooded conditions and then converged in both 1990 and 1991 as the wetlands developed.},

Especially noticeable effect has been attained in the field of microbial ecology, where new experimental approaches provided in-depth assessments of the composition, functions, and dynamic changes of complex microbial communities. Because even a single high-throughput experiment produces large amounts of data, powerful statistical techniques of multivariate analysis are well suited to analyze and interpret these datasets. Many different multivariate techniques are available, and often it is not clear which method should be applied to a particular dataset. In this review we describe and compare the most widely used multivariate statistical techniques including exploratory, interpretive, and discriminatory procedures. We consider several important limitations and assumptions of these methods, and we present examples of how these approaches have been utilized in recent studies to provide insight into the ecology of the microbial world. Finally, we offer suggestions for the selection of appropriate methods based on the research question and dataset structure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

* Using radioactive and stable isotopes, we followed the transport of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in the CMNs of two fungal species to plants that differed in their carbon (C) source strength, and correlated the transport to the expression of mycorrhiza-inducible plant P (MtPt4) and ammonium (1723.m00046) transporters in mycorrhizal roots.

* AM fungi discriminated between host plants that shared a CMN and preferentially allocated nutrients to high-quality (nonshaded) hosts. However, the fungus also supplied low-quality (shaded) hosts with nutrients and maintained a high colonization rate in these plants. Fungal P transport was correlated to the expression of MtPt4. The expression of the putative ammonium transporter 1723.m00046 was dependent on the fungal nutrient supply and was induced when the CMN had access to N.

* Biological market theory has emerged as a tool with which the strategic investment of competing partners in trading networks can be studied. Our work demonstrates how fungal partners are able to retain bargaining power, despite being obligately dependent on their hosts.},

  abstract = {The sequence of species observed after a relatively large space is opened up is a consequence of the following mechanisms. "Opportunist" species with broad dispersal powers and rapid growth to maturity usually arrive first and occupy empty space. These species cannot invade and grow in the presence of adults of their own or other species. Several alternative mechanisms may then determine which species replace these early occupants. Three models of such mechanisms have been proposed. The first "facilitation" model suggests that the entry and growth of the later species is dependent upon the earlier species "preparing the ground"; only after this can later species colonize. Evidence in support of this model applies mainly to certain primary successions and in heterotrophic succession. A second "tolerance" model suggests that a predictable sequence is produced by the existence of species that have evolved different strategies for exploiting resources. Later species will be those able to tolerate lower levels of resources than earlier ones. Thus they can invade and grow to maturity in the presence of those that preceded them. At present there exists little evidence in support of this model. A third "inhibition" model suggests that all species resist invasions of competitors. The first occupants preempt the space and will continue to exclude or inhibit later colonists until the former die or are damaged, thus releasing resources. Only then can later colonists reach maturity. A considerable body of evidence exists in support of this model. In the majority of natural communities succession is frequently interrupted by major disturbances, such as fires, storms, insect plagues, etc., starting the process all over again. However, if not interrupted, it eventually reaches a stage in which further change is on a small scale as individuals die and are replaced. The pattern of these changes will depend upon whether individuals are more likely to be replaced by a member of their own or another species. If the former, stability will be assured. However, in terrestrial communities, conditions in the soil in the immediate vicinity of long-lived plants may become modified in such a way that offspring of the same species are much less favored than those of other species. A likely cause is the buildup of host-specific pathogenic soil organisms near a long-lived plant. In this case, the species at each local site keep changing, producing local instability. Whether the average species composition of the whole tract does not change, exhibiting global stability, or whether it keeps changing has not yet been decided for any natural community.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species’ relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare—the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.},

  abstract = {Fens occur in many Colorado Rocky Mountain watersheds that have historically been affected by metal mining activities. A persistent effect of mining is acid rock drainage (ARD), which flows from mine adits and tailings piles. ARD water has low pH and high concentrations of heavy metals and can pollute surface and ground water supporting fens. There are few floristic differences between polluted and pristine fens, and it is unclear what long-term affects ARD has on fens. We investigated decomposition of native leaf litter and a standard litter for two years in fourCarex aquatilis-dominated subalpine fens. Two of the fens are affected by ARD, and their source waters have pH {$<$}4.0 and high concentrations of dissolved Zn, Cu, Mn, and Pb. The other two fens are relatively pristine, with source water pH {$>$} 6.0 and low metal concentrations. ARD significantly reduced native litter decomposition rates over two years (ANOVA, p {$<$}0.01) with 63\% of the initial mass of leaf litter remaining at the most pristine site (Peru Creek fen), 47 \% at a moderately polluted site (Argentine fen), and 23\% at the most pristine site (Deer Creek fen). ARD also reduced the quality of litter produced. Standard litter decomposed more rapidly than native litter at all sites, particularly Peru Creek fen. Site, representing fen environment, and litter origin, representing native vs. standard litter, significantly affected decomposition rates (ANOVA, p {$<$} 0.0001) Pristine fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal rich fens, while polluted fens had decomposition rates comparable with boreal poor fens and bogs. Acid rock drainage causes ecosystem-level responses in organic matter processing, peat accumulation rates, and most likely in nutrient cycling, which could have long-term affects on fen primary and secondary production and other functions.},

  abstract = {A 4-year monitoring of 16 eutrophic peri-urban ponds located in the southeastern periphery of Brussels has shown that different aquatic plants have different interrelationship with phytoplankton. Extensive submerged macrophytic vegetation has shown the strongest effect on phytoplankton biomass and composition and seems to be crucial for the maintenance of the clear-water state through its capacity to buffer the effects of nutrient enrichment. Restoration of submerged macrophytes seems to be essential for successful biomanipulation of eutrophic ponds. Biomanipulation induced revegetation with submerged macrophytes resulted in the restoration of the clear-water state in the two biomanipulated ponds. Fish removal not accompanied with the restoration of submerged macrophytes in the third biomanipulated pond did not lead to the decrease in phytoplankton biomass. The removal of submerged macrophytes from a clear-water pond invariably led to a shift towards the turbid state often accompanied with cyanobacterial bloom formation. Profuse growth of filamentous green algae also had a negative effect on phytoplankton growth, albeit less strong than that of submerged macrophytes. Floating-leaved plants did not show a significant effect on phytoplankton biomass outside their stands.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

  abstract = {A manmade stormwater wetland in Kalmar, SE Sweden, sized 1 ha and receiving water from residential and road areas, was monitored over the first years after inundation with respect to chemistry and biology. Water flow and chemistry was analysed in years 2–4, mainly on a monthly basis, but, in the final year, every second month. This revealed that total nitrogen, according to the Swedish Environmental Quality Criteria (EQC), typically showed moderate or high concentrations, whereas total phosphorous levels were very high or extremely high. Metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) concentrations were low or moderate in terms of EQC. Yearly average reduction of nitrogen was 173 kg ha−1 y−1, tending to increase over time, and for phosphorous 12.1 kg ha−1 y−1, tending to decrease. Vegetation analysis was performed in years 1–4 by noting all species in 27 consecutive zones around the wetland system. This showed that one year after filling with water, the vegetation was already well established with {$>$}30 plant species in the entire pond system, and this increased only slightly. After four years, the shoreline vegetation cover had become denser, especially with larger graminoids such as common reed (Phragmites australis) and sea club-rush (Bolboschoenus maritimus), and submersed vegetation almost disappeared. There was a tendency for common species to become more dominant, and for less common species to become rarer. Using sweep net sampling of benthic invertebrates during years 0–2, ca 50 species/higher taxa were observed during the first year, largely because of the appearance of many beetles, especially dytiscids. However, these decreased the following years. Apart from these animals, in the first few months the invertebrate colonisation was dominated by chironomids and corixids, whereas later prominent increases were noticed for the isopod Asellus aquaticus, the snail Physa fontinalis, and the mayfly nymph Cloeon dipterum. The results are discussed in terms of wetland values for biodiversity and nutrient reduction, suggesting that these objectives seem possible to combine in stormwater wetlands.},

Here, we evaluate if, and to what extend, dual-purpose wetlands benefit local and regional diversity of agricultural landscapes. We analysed composition and α, β, and γ diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among dual-purpose wetlands in an agricultural region in southwest Sweden in relation to local (water quality, wetland morphology, succession stage, proximity to other aquatic habitats) and landscape parameters (regional connectivity, wetland density). Diversity of mature agricultural ponds was used as a standard to evaluate the value of dual-purpose wetlands. Dual-purpose wetlands sustained α, β, and γ diversity similar to that of natural lentic water bodies in agricultural landscapes in the region and elsewhere. Over 80\% of the overall species richness was attributed to β diversity, and each created wetland contributed to overall species accumulation. Ecosystem parameters explained 19\% of the compositional variation among assemblages, but were only marginally related to diversity. Wetland density promoted α and γ diversity, while spatial heterogeneity (β) remained equally high, independent of wetland density. Our results indicate that catchment-scale wetland creation for simultaneous retention and diversity purposes benefits the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes, particularly if the density of aquatic habitats is increased by at least 30\%.},

  abstract = {Thousands of wetland restorations have been done in the glaciated mid-continent of the United States. Wetlands in this region revegetate by natural recolonization after hydrology is restored. The floristic composition of the vegetation and seed banks of 10 restored wetlands in northern Iowa were compared to those of 10 adjacent natural wetlands to test the hypothesis that communities rapidly develop through natural recolonization. Restoration programs in the prairie pothole region assume that the efficient-community hypothesis is true: all plant species that can become established and survive under the environmental conditions found at a site will eventually be found growing there and/or will be found in its seed bank. Three years after restoration, natural wetlands had a mean of 46 species compared to 27 species for restored wetlands. Some guilds of species have significantly fewer (e.g., sedge meadow) or more (e.g., submersed aquatics) species in restored than natural wetlands. The distribution and abundance of most species at different elevations were significantly different in natural and restored wetlands. The seed banks of restored wetlands contained fewer species and fewer seeds than those of natural wetlands. There were, however, some similarities between the vegetation of restored and natural wetlands. Emergent species richness in restored wetlands was generally similar to that in natural wetlands, although there were fewer shallow emergent species in restored wetlands. The seed banks of restored wetlands, however, were not similar to those of natural wetlands in composition, mean species richness, or mean total seed density. Submersed aquatic, wet prairie, and sedge meadow species were not present in the seed banks of restored wetlands. These patterns of recolonization seem related to dispersal ability, indicating the efficient-community hypothesis cannot be completely accepted as a basis for restorations in the prairie pothole region.},

  abstract = {Boreal forests harbour diverse fungal communities with decisive roles in decomposition and plant nutrition. Difficulties in studying soil fungi have limited knowledge about how fungal communities are shaped. The objective of this thesis was to study factors influencing soil fungal communities, aiming for increased understanding of their effect on environmental processes.

Using next generation sequencing, responses of fungal communities to their physical-chemical environment, and responses of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi to logging, were investigated. In a trenching experiment, this technology, combined with measurements of decomposition and vertical nitrogen distribution, enabled evaluation of direct and indirect involvement of ECM fungi in humus decomposition. 

Fungal community composition was found to be significantly related to soil fertility, with ascomycetes dominating in less fertile forests, whereas basidiomycetes increased under more fertile conditions. ECM fungi were found to more or less disappear with complete clear-cutting and reestablishment of ECM diversity took several decades. However, a clear positive relationship between the amount of retention trees and ECM fungal species richness and abundance was found. By excluding ECM fungi, nitrogen limitation of saprotrophic fungi was released, increasing litter decomposition rates. However, this effect was overshadowed by an almost complete loss of oxidative enzyme activities in deeper humus layers, associated with removal of ECM fungi by trenching.

Our results indicate ECM fungi to be the principal decomposers of boreal forest humus layers. This, together with the predictability of soil fungal communities, reinforces the importance and ability of integrating rhizosphere microorganisms, in particular ECM fungi, in forest ecosystem models.},

The performance in the purification of the mine discharge and the concurrent ecosystem development within the system during the period of 1985–2000 has been studied. The untreated wastewater contained rather high concentrations of cadmium (Cd) (0.05 mg L−1), lead (Pb) (11.5 mg L−1), and zinc (Zn) (14.5 mg L−1), which greatly exceed the upper limits for industrial wastewater discharge in China. The constructed wetland system effectively removed Cd by 94.00\%, Pb by 99.04\%, Zn by 97.30\%, and total suspended solids (TSS) by 98.95\% from the mine discharge over a long period (over 16 years) leading to significant improvement in water quality; it was also found that there were no significantly annual or monthly variations in pH values, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn concentrations in water collected from the outlet of the wetland. Moreover, diversity and abundance of living organisms, including protozoan, higher plants, terrestrial animals, and birds, increased gradually. The 16-year monitoring results showed a reciprocal relationship, at a certain extent, between restoration of the wetland ecosystem, in other words, the maturity of the wetland, and the long-term efficiency and stability on purifying heavy metal-contaminated wastewater.},

Broods of wood ducks (Aix sponsa), Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and mallards (Anas platy-rhynchos) were observed on both mine sites. In addition, 17 species of mammals and 8 and 7 species of amphibians and reptiles, respectively, were observed using these wetlands.

  abstract = {Fungal communities have been shown to be highly sensitive toward shifts in plant diversity and species composition in forest ecosystems. However, little is known about the impact of forest management on fungal diversity and community composition of geographically separated sites. This study examined the effects of four different forest management types on soil fungal communities. These forest management types include age class forests of young managed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), with beech stands age of approximately 30 years, age class beech stands with an age of approximately 70 years, unmanaged beech stands, and coniferous stands dominated by either pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or spruce (Picea abies Karst.) which are located in three study sites across Germany. Soil were sampled from 48 study plots and we employed fungal ITS rDNA pyrotag sequencing to assess the soil fungal diversity and community structure. We found that forest management type significantly affects the Shannon diversity of soil fungi and a significant interaction effect of study site and forest management on the fungal operational taxonomic units richness. Consequently distinct fungal communities were detected in the three study sites and within the four forest management types, which were mainly related to the main tree species. Further analysis of the contribution of soil properties revealed that C/N ratio being the most important factor in all the three study sites whereas soil pH was significantly related to the fungal community in two study sites. Functional assignment of the fungal communities indicated that 38\% of the observed communities were Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) and their distribution is significantly influenced by the forest management. Soil pH and C/N ratio were found to be the main drivers of the ECM fungal community composition. Additional fungal community similarity analysis revealed the presence of study site and management type specific ECM genera. This study extends our knowledge on the impact of forest management type on general and ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure in temperate forests. High plasticity across management types but also study site specific spatial distribution revealed new insights in the ECM fungal distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {In temperate and boreal forest ecosystems, nitrogen (N) limitation of tree metabolism is alleviated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. As forest soils age, the primary source of N in soil switches from inorganic (NH4+ and NO3−) to organic (mostly proteins). It has been hypothesized that ECM fungi adapt to the most common N source in their environment, which implies that fungi growing in older forests would have greater protein degradation abilities. Moreover, recent results for a model ECM fungal species suggest that organic N uptake requires a glucose supply. To test the generality of these hypotheses, we screened 55 strains of 13 Suillus species with different ecological preferences for their in vitro protein degradation abilities. Suillus species preferentially occurring in mature forests, where soil contains more organic matter, had significantly higher protease activity than those from young forests with low-organic-matter soils or species indifferent to forest age. Within species, the protease activities of ecotypes from soils with high or low soil organic N content did not differ significantly, suggesting resource partitioning between mineral and organic soil layers. The secreted protease mixtures were strongly dominated by aspartic peptidases. Glucose addition had variable effects on secreted protease activity; in some species, it triggered activity, but in others, activity was repressed at high concentrations. Collectively, our results indicate that protease activity, a key ectomycorrhizal functional trait, is positively related to environmental N source availability but is also influenced by additional factors, such as carbon availability.},

  abstract = {In developed forests and secondary successional sites, host plants can readily access ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi because of the ubiquitous ECM mycelia and spores in soil, but this is not the case in some primary successional sites. In a volcanic desert on Mt Fuji, Japan, most of the area is non-mycorrhizal habitat and has poorly developed soil spore-banks. ECM habitat, i.e. pioneer willow shrubs and a small surrounding area containing ECM mycelia, are quite sparsely distributed, accounting for about 1 \% of the ground surface in total. Such unique conditions provide us an interesting opportunity to explore the magnitude and role of direct mycelial connections between plants, i.e. ECM networks, in the field. It is difficult to observe individual ECM mycelial spread in soil, but the distribution of sporocarps and ECM roots having the same genotype indicate the spread of a mycelium in soil. We applied microsatellite markers to genotype sporocarps and ECM tips, and found that genets of two pioneer Laccaria species were small in size (mostly {$<$}1 m) and ephemeral. In contrast, genets of Scleroderma included some long-lived large genets ({$>$}10 m). These results indicate that ECM networks could vary considerably in size and longevity, even in the same site and associated with the same host species. Field transplanting experiment revealed that current-year willow seedlings rarely formed ECM associations in most habitats of the desert and showed poor growth. ECM infection from spores did not significantly improve seedling growth, indicating a small isolated mycelium on a tiny seeding may not be enough to acquire sufficient nutrients from extremely nutrient poor scoria. In contrast, seedlings transplanted near the pre-established willow shrubs, where ECM networks are available, readily formed ECM associations and grew well. Moreover, artificially reproduced ECM networks in previously non-mycorrhizal habitats significantly improved the growth of connected seedlings in 10 of 11 ECM fungal species in this desert. Therefore, ECM networks appear to be mostly positive and could be critical to seedling establishment, at least in this primary successional setting. Some previously proposed mechanisms may be less relevant to the observed positive effect of ECM networks on seedling establishment. For example, plant-to-plant carbon transfer through ECM networks might work for seedlings in dark forest floor, but not in primary successional settings characterized by strong sun light. More relevant mechanisms should include rapid ECM colonization with low costs, larger absorbing surface area than a solitary mycelium, and nutrient translocation within a network from nutrient rich soil patches to most demanding parts, often seedlings.},

This carbon is used for building extensive mycelial networks in the soil as well as for metabolic activity related to nutrient uptake. Here we discuss the factors that regulate the production and turnover of EMM and its role in soil C dynamics and nitrogen retention. C availability seems to be the key factor determining EMM production and possibly its standing biomass in forests but direct effects of mineral nutrient availability on the EMM can also be important. There is great uncertainty about the rate of turnover of EMM, and the increasing evidence that residues of EM fungi play a major role in the formation of stable N and C in soil organic matter highlights the need to include mycorrhizal effects in models of global soil C stores.},

Small differences were found between the metal-contaminated population and the three ‘clean’ populations when seedlings were grown in 1.0 μg ml−1Zn and 10.0 μg ml−1Pb treatment solutions. In general, however, different populations of seedlings showed similar growth responses, metal uptake and indices of Zn, Pb and Cd tolerance when cultured in the same metal-contaminated media for 89 d or in the same metal treatment solutions (ZnSO4:1.0 and 4.0 μg ml−1Zn; Pb(NO3)2: 10.0 and 25.0 μg ml−1Pb; CdSO4: 0.5 and 1.0 μg ml−1Cd) for 3 weeks. There was insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the metal-contaminated population has evolved to a Zn-, Pb- or Cd-tolerant ecotype but the results indicated some differentiation between the populations with that from Hong Kong being the least productive under the experimental conditions used.

However, high shoot concentrations of elements might disperse them and could be harmful to grazing animals. The aim of this investigation was to find out which of the three properties; low-accumulation, root accumulation or shoot accumulation of elements, occur in four of the most common wetland species growing on an old submerged mine tailings and if their properties can be determined by a hydroponic experiment. Above- and below-ground parts of Salix (mixed tissue from S. phylicifolia and S. borealis), Carex rostrata, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Phragmites australis were sampled and analysed for Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and As. Differences in uptake and translocation properties of the same plant species were observed between field-grown plants and plants grown in hydroponics. These differences were probably due to processes in the soil–root interface. Thus, hydroponic screening studies should not be used to find suitable species for vegetation of wet-covered mine tailings. Most species were found to have restricted translocation of elements to the shoot, i.e. they were root accumulators, and only the shoot concentrations of Salix for Cd and Zn and E. angustifolium for Pb might be toxic to grazing animals. Thus, plant establishment on submerged tailings can be a safe method to stabilise the metals.},

This paper describes the integration of sediment microbial activities and natural precipitation processes, along with approaches to defining the contaminant load from the mine wastes. The contaminant removal rates, which can be expected by a wetland sediment, are summarized and how they need to be reflected in the wetland size required, and the carbon supply which is needed. Contaminant loading from mining wastes can be balanced by wetland ecological processes, including wetland primary production and microbial mineralization in the sediment. This ecological engineering approach is demonstrated using case studies on hard-rock mining waste in Canada.},

We investigated the effects of four procedural modifications to library preparation for high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The following treatments were considered: 1) the amount of soil used in DNA extraction, 2) the inclusion of additional steps (freeze/thaw cycles, sonication, or hot water bath incubation) in the extraction procedure, 3) the amount of DNA template used in PCR, and 4) the effect of sample pooling, either physically or computationally. Soils from two different ecosystems in Minnesota, USA, one prairie and one forest site, were used to assess the generality of our results. The first three treatments did not significantly influence observed fungal OTU richness or community structure at either site. Physical pooling captured more OTU richness compared to individual samples, but total OTU richness at each site was highest when individual samples were computationally combined. We conclude that standard extraction kit protocols are well optimized for fungal HTS surveys, but because sample pooling can significantly influence OTU richness estimates, it is important to carefully consider the study aims when planning sampling procedures.},

  abstract = {Question: Do regional species pools, landscape isolation or on-site constraints cause plants from different guilds to vary in their ability to colonize restored wetlands? Location: Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota, USA. Methods: Floristic surveys of 41 restored wetlands were made three and 12 years after reflooding to determine changes in local species pools for eight plant guilds. The effect of landscape isolation on colonization efficiency was evaluated for each guild by plotting local species pools against distance to nearby natural wetlands, and the relative importance of dispersal vs. on-site constraints in limiting colonization was explored by comparing the local species pools of restored and natural wetlands within the region. Results: Of the 517 wetland plant taxa occurring in the region, 50\% have established within 12 years. The proportion of the regional species pool represented in local species pools differed among guilds, with sedge-meadow perennials, emergent perennials and floating/submersed aquatics least represented (33-36\%) and annual guilds most represented (74-94\%). Colonization-to-extinction ratios suggest that floating/submersed aquatics have already reached a species equilibrium while sedge-meadow and emergent perennials are still accumulating species. Increasing distance to nearest wetlands decreased the proportion of the regional species pool present in local pools for all guilds except native annuals and woody plants. The maximum proportion predicted, assuming no distance constraint, was comparable to the lowest-diversity natural wetlands for most perennial guilds, and also lower than what was achieved in a planted, weeded restoration. Conclusions: A biotic constraints seem to limit the colonization of floating/submersed aquatics into natural or restored wetlands, whereas all other guilds are potentially constrained by dispersal or biotic factors (i.e. competition from invasive species). Using species pools to evaluate restoration progress revealed that immigration potential varies considerably among guilds, that local species richness does not necessarily correspond to immigration limitations, and that some guilds (e.g. sedge-meadow perennials) will likely benefit more than others from being planted at restoration sites.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are obligate biotrophs (Glomeromycota), which live symbiotically in the roots of most land plants and facilitate mineral nutrition of their hosts. Their spores are able to germinate in the absence of host-derived signals, but are unable to complete the life cycle without establishing a functional symbiosis with a host plant. Such behaviour did not represent a selective disadvantage, as a result of diverse survival strategies allowing them to compensate for the lack of host-regulated germination and to overcome their obligate biotrophic state. The ability to form hyphal fusions (anastomoses) between compatible mycelia may represent an important mechanism evolved by AMF to increase their chances of survival, since fungal germlings can plug into pre-existing extraradical mycelial networks, thus gaining immediate access to plant-derived carbon before asymbiotic growth arrest. In fusions between hyphae of the same or different individual germlings of the same isolate, perfect anastomoses occur with the highest frequency and are characterized by protoplasm continuity and complete fusion of hyphal walls. High anastomosis frequencies are also detected between extraradical mycelial networks produced by the same isolate, spreading from plants of different species, genera and families. Pre- and post-fusion incompatibility are often observed in hyphal interactions between asymbiotic and symbiotic mycelium and between genetically different germlings belonging to the same isolate, while pre-fusion incompatible responses, hindering hyphal fusions, occur between germlings of geographically different isolates. The analysis of vegetative compatibility/incompatibility during hyphal fusions represents a valuable tool for genetic studies of AMF, which are recalcitrant to axenic cultivation. Molecular analyses of the progeny of mycelium derived from nonself vegetative fusions of genetically different germlings of R. irregularis showed that genetic exchange occurs, despite low anastomosis frequencies and post-fusion incompatible responses, suggesting that anastomosis between genetically different mycelia may represent a recombination mechanism in the absence of an evident sexual cycle.},

  abstract = {Nutrient-rich water bodies are usually expected to host low species richness at the local scale (water body). Nevertheless, they can support a diverse and sometimes unique biodiversity when diversity is considered at a regional scale. This discrepancy between the two scales is well documented for natural water bodies, but little is known about biodiversity of artificial water bodies, like fish ponds. We hypothesise that nutrient-rich water bodies can collectively host high species richness at the regional scale. Thus, these are important ecosystems for the regional conservation of biodiversity. We investigated 84 fish ponds in the Dombes region, France, with five taxonomic groups: macrophytes, phytoplankton, macroinvertebrates, dragonflies, and amphibians. Species richness patterns were determined for α- (single pond), β- (between ponds), and γ- (regional pond network) levels. For most studied species groups, richness per fish pond and at the regional level proved to be relatively high in comparison with natural ponds in other landscapes. Contribution of α-diversity to regional diversity was highest for dragonflies with 41 \%, and lowest for amphibians and macrophytes with 16 and 18 \%, respectively. For macroinvertebrate families and phytoplankton genera it was intermediate. Contribution of β-diversity to regional diversity was similar for all species groups with 22–25 \%. Furthermore, some ponds hosted a large number of less frequent species and some endangered species, indicating that the conservation of biodiversity of fish ponds must be established at a regional scale.},

We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant beingRana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, andBufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish andAmbystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.},

  abstract = {Carbon (C), nutrients and water (H2O) have been known for five decades to flow between plants through ectomycorrhizal (EM) networks. This flux has the potential to affect plant and fungal performance and resource distribution within communities. We asked two questions: (1) What are the pathways and mechanisms for C, nutrient and H2O fluxes between plants through EM networks? (2) What are the magnitude, fate and importance of C, nutrient and H2O transfer among EM plants? Mycorrhizal networks provide a distinct pathway for resource fluxes among plants and mycorrhizal fungi, partitioning them away from other competing soil microbes and plant roots in the soil matrix, and potentially providing a competitive advantage (or disadvantage) for some individuals involved in the network. Carbon and nutrients flow symplastically and apoplastically through mycorrhizal symbionts, hyphae and rhizomorphs along source-sink gradients across the networking mycelia and plant community. EM networks can also facilitate the hydraulic redistribution of soil or plant water following water potential gradients. Carbon fluxes through EM networks have been shown to supply 0–10 \% of autotrophic, up to 85 \% of partial myco-heterotrophic (MH), and 100 \% of fully MH plant C. This C supply has been loosely associated with the increased survival and growth of autotrophic plants, but has been shown to be essential for the survival of MH plants. Network-mediated nitrogen (N) fluxes between N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing plants have supplied up to 40 \% of receiver N, and this has been associated with increased plant productivity. Fluxes between non-N2-fixing plants have supplied {$<$}5 \% of receiver N. Hydraulic redistribution involving EM fungi has supplied up to 50 \% of plant water; this has been shown as essential for plant survival in some cases. However, uncertainty remains as to how much of this water transfers through EM networks. Phosphorus transfer through EM networks has not been adequately demonstrated. Overall, this review chapter shows that resource fluxes though EM networks are sufficiently large in some cases to facilitate plant establishment and growth. Resource fluxes through EM networks may thus serve as a method for interactions and cross-scale feedbacks in the development of plant-microbial communities. The outcome of resource transfer through EM networks for the stability of terrestrial ecosystems depends upon the environmental context.},

  abstract = {Plants of the same and different species are often linked by common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), and there is substantial disagreement in the literature about whether these linkages have important effects on plant-plant interactions, beyond simply providing mycorrhizal inoculum. Here, I attempt to reconcile opposing viewpoints by reviewing available evidence for three distinct mechanisms by which CMNs can affect plant-plant interactions. I also analyze the details of manipulative field experiments that have been conducted to test CMN effects on plant-plant interactions, and make recommendations for the kinds of future studies that will be most useful in moving forward. I argue that few experiments have unequivocally tested whether CMNs have unique effects on plant-plant interactions, and that these experiments have largely been ignored in favor of debates about the magnitude of resource flows (especially carbon) from plant to plant through CMNs. I suggest that progress on the debate will only be made through more thorough testing of alternative mechanisms besides plant-to-plant carbon flow, especially coupled with experimental manipulations of CMNs to test for consequences on specific aspects of plant community ecological processes.},

Body size of some ranid larvae was larger in cattle-access wetlands but this trend did not exist for juveniles or adults. Dissolved oxygen was lower, while specific conductivity and turbidity were higher in cattle-access wetlands. Mean biomass of detritus was lower in cattle-access wetlands compared to non-access wetlands; no differences were detected in algal biomass.

  abstract = {Sedimentation and alterations of natural hydroperiods from watershed cultivation have affected most depressional wetlands in the Great Plains. This can result in altered plant community structure through changes in water availability and depth as well as burial of seed banks. The vegetation and seed banks of 15 wetlands were sampled within the Rainwater Basin Region of Nebraska. Our objectives were to: (1) compare wetland seed bank communities among wetlands with different watershed land uses (reference, restored and impacted by watershed cultivation); (2) determine the available seed bank following sediment removal and establish if wetland zonation occurs in the deeper sediment layer of pre-scraped agricultural wetlands; and (3) determine the similarity between extant vegetation and the seed banks for each wetland land use treatment. There were no significant differences in seed bank species richness and the number and composition of annual, perennial, native, or exotic species among reference, restored, and agricultural playas. Restored wetlands had a greater number of upland species germinate from the surface soil seed bank compared to reference and agricultural playas. Availability of seeds after 30 cm of soil was removed (to simulate available seed bank if the wetland was to be restored) in crop land use wetlands was low (2–52 seeds/wetland) making determination of wetland zonation difficult. There was no difference in the similarity between the seed bank and extant vegetation among the three land use treatments. Sediment removal appears to be successful in removing weedy and exotic species from the seed bank; however, the seed bank is not the primary source for playa wetland revegetation. Restored and reference wetlands have similar seed bank community characteristics (i.e., richness) however, each wetland land use treatment was associated with differing plant species and plant guilds.},

  abstract = {Transport and exchange of nutrients is a key feature to the function of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and therefore also to the function of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). These networks establish between two or more plant individuals and one or more extraradical mycelia (EM). Complex networks with many nodes and linkages can be observed in sterile cultures and are probably common in nature. This chapter aims to describe how the nutrient dynamics of the CMNs influence plant competition. The discussion will concentrate on the rather variable access of the individual plants to the nutrient pool in the EM. Plant-to-plant transfer of nutrients via one or more connective EM does not appear to occur in significant quantities except in special cases. Competition between individual plants is in general asymmetric such that larger individuals will obtain a disproportionate share of a limited resource and suppress the growth of smaller individuals. Our major challenge is to unravel whether nutrient dynamics in CMNs will result in even stronger or in more relaxed competition. We investigated common outcomes in competition studies including: (a) adult plant-seedling combinations; (b) intraspecific competition of plant populations of similar age and (c) interspecific competition of plants of similar age. Results from root organ culture models indicate that AM fungi transfer phosphorus (P) to roots representing the strongest carbon (C) source strength. This is in accordance with the results of 32P-aided studies of P translocation in CMNs with large plants and seedlings. An evaluation of these results together with CMN studies not involving tracers leads us to suggest that nutrients in the EM are distributed to the plants in accordance with their size or C source strength. In consequence, the CMN may rather amplify than relax the competition towards establishing seedlings. Our model implies, however, that the suppression of the seedling is only temporary and is likely to shift to a typical mycorrhizal growth response when the large plant become senescent or is grazed. In conspecific plant populations we predict that AM fungal networks confer an advantage to plant individuals that are for various reasons slightly larger than their neighbors. Interspecific plant competition is more difficult to predict as different combinations of species-specific traits may either amplify or relax nutrient competition in a CMN in addition to effects of size differences. Future research needs are discussed including the need to investigate roles of CMNs in interplant transfer of plant signals and allelochemicals.},

To examine the effects of AMD precipitates independently of aqueous effects, four substrata treatments, clean sandstone, clean limestone, AMD precipitate-coated sandstone and coated limestone, were placed in a circumneutral stream of high water quality for 4 weeks. Iron and Al were the most abundant metals on rocks with AMD precipitate, and significantly decreased after the exposure. Precipitate on the substrata did not significantly affect macroinvertebrate or periphyton density and species composition. In an additional experiment, percent survival of caged live caddisflies was significantly lower when exposed in situ for 5 days in an AMD affected stream than in a reference stream. Caddisfly whole-body concentrations of all combined metals and Fe alone were significantly higher in the AMD stream. Whole-body metal concentrations were higher in killed caddisflies than in live, indicating the importance of passive uptake. The results suggest the aqueous chemical environment of AMD had a greater affect on organisms than a coating of recent AMD precipitate on the substrata (ca. 0.5 mm thick), and treatment that improves water quality in AMD impacted streams has the potential to aid in recovery of the abiotic and biotic benthic environment.},

In this chapter, we discuss multiple hypotheses that have been put forth to explain the specificity of the Alnus ECM symbiosis and consider their strengths and weaknesses in light of current research on the topic. In addition to reviewing the range of suggested explanations, we also propose and discuss a new alternative explanation of Alnus ECM specificity involving three-way interactions among Alnus plants, ECM fungi, and Frankia bacteria. With specific regard to common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), we believe they may play an important role in the specificity observed in the Alnus ECM system. To understand that role in the larger context of research on Alnus ECM fungal communities, we begin our chapter with a synopsis of the studies documenting the unique specificity pattern. From there, we discuss why it appears to be advantageous for Alnus plants not to participate in interspecific CMNs. Finally, we elaborate on how specificity may be established and maintained in the Alnus ECM system and suggest what we consider to be promising future research directions.},

  abstract = {The establishment of common mycelial networks by mycorrhizal fungi shared between host plants depends on the ability of neighboring plants to enter into mycorrhizal associations with compatible fungal species. Such compatibility is governed by the potential mycorrhiza specificities of the symbionts. Mycorrhiza specificities exist along a continuum from low specificity (association with multiple partners) to high specificity (association with one or few partners). Although the ability of symbionts to form mycorrhizas may be largely governed by host-fungus gene interactions as influenced by co-evolutionary events, mycorrhizal associations in natural ecosystems can also be influenced by environmental factors (e.g. soil) and biological factors (e.g. different neighboring host species), phenomena referred to as “ecological specificity.” For example, in natural settings, mycorrhizal fungi often express “host preference” wherein fungi may be more common on a particular host in mixed-host settings than would be expected by random species assemblage within the fungal and plant communities. Mycorrhiza specificity phenomena significantly influence plant community dynamics, particularly plant succession. Early seral plants can positively affect the establishment of later-seral plants by maintaining commonly shared mycorrhizal fungi, and thus affecting the function of common mycelial networks over time. Such knowledge provides guidance for ecosystem managers to maintain “legacy” early -seral plants that benefit later-seral plants via shared mycorrhizal fungus species. Understanding specificity phenomena is also crucial for predicting the successful migration of plants and compatible mycorrhizal fungi during climate change. We review mycorrhiza specificity terminology and types of specificity phenomena, and suggest use of common terms to provide consistency in addressing this research topic. We also provide extensive examples from diverse ecosystems on the ability (or inability) of neighboring plants to develop common mycelial networks.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a group of soil and root inhabiting fungi that represent an ancient plant-fungi symbiosis. These fungi interconnect multiple plant individuals and species simultaneously generating a complex fungal network belowground that plays a significant role in shaping plant community composition and ecosystem productivity. However, the underlying mechanisms as to how AM fungal networks and their diversity influence plant performance and community structure are not always predictable and are frequently debated. Although all potential plant hosts may be able to associate with all AM fungi, plant-AM fungal associations can result in a range of AM fungal facilitative and antagonistic effects on plants. Although the facilitative effects of AM fungi have long been studied, the extent and mechanisms of AM fungal antagonistic effects are much less understood. Moreover, AM fungi are observed to vary in their functional properties and temporal patterns adding further complexity to the potential mechanisms by which AM fungi and the diversity of AM fungi determine plant community composition and productivity through their facilitative and antagonistic effects on plants. Here we review the potential mechanisms by which AM fungal communities facilitate greater diversity and productivity in plant communities, as well as the potential mechanisms by which AM fungi may be antagonistic to plant performance. Specifically we address how AM fungal communities might facilitate greater plant community performance through functional complementarity among AM fungi as a result of functional, spatial and temporal niche segregation. We also address facilitative and antagonistic aspects of AM fungi through their ability to allocate resources among plant community members that consequently facilitates plant recruitment and alters plant-plant competitive outcomes. By considering the multiple facets by which AM fungi may be facilitative or antagonistic to plants we identify potential knowledge gaps in mechanistically predicting how AM fungal communities shape plant community composition and maintain ecosystem productivity.},

  abstract = {The population genetics and spatial structure of the fairy ring fungus Marasmius oreades (Bolt. : Fr.) Fr. was studied by DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF). Basidiocarp samples were collected from fairy rings from two separate sand dune systems of about 560 m2 and 1750 m2, respectively, on the Lista Peninsula in southwestern Norway in 1996. Samples were collected after a careful mapping of fairy rings and a vegetation survey of the composition and spatial structure of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. DAF with standard arbitrary oligonucleotide primers was used to examine the genetic relationship between basidiocarp samples. The study showed that the fungal population contained a high number of genotypes and that about 90\% of the fairy rings represented a separate genet. Both cluster and phylogenetic analyses of DAF amplification products established relationships between fairy rings and showed that genetically similar basidiocarps were found close to each other. Overall results showed a weak correspondence between genotype and spatial distribution and no correspondence between genotype and composition of the surrounding vegetation. Furthermore, the occurrence of the four dominant sand dune grass species was randomly distributed among the localities housing the various fungal genotypes, indicating that the fungus did not exhibit genotypic specialization to the various grass species that could host it as a pathogen. Results show that establishment of new individuals generally was mediated by basidiospore dispersal and not by fragmenting dikaryotic, vegetative mycelium, as previously proposed.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes.},

Water quality improvement provided by constructed wetlands is well known, but little is known about the ecological function of these treatment systems. A passive treatment system was constructed in eastern Oklahoma to treat AMD from an abandoned coal mine. Multiple water quality parameters were monitored. Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined throughout the system to estimate productivity. Multi-plate artificial substrate samplers were deployed to quantify and evaluate the macroinvertebrate assemblage within each cell. Productivity between treatment cells varied significantly. The cells receiving effluent from anoxic organic substrate had elevated nutrient levels, which led to elevated productivity. Chlorophyll a levels reached hypereutrophic conditions into final treatment cells. Macroinvertebrate community structure was significantly different among treatment cells. Primary cells produced more diverse and evenly distributed taxa, including the presence of moderately intolerant taxa. The treatment system exhibited early successional stage ecosystem functions and trends toward destructive oscillations.},

The expansion of commercial harvesting in many parts of the world has led to widespread concern about overharvesting and possible damage to fungal resources. In 1975, we started a field research project to investigate the effects of mushroom picking on fruit body occurrence. The three treatments applied were the harvesting techniques picking and cutting, and the concomitant trampling of the forest floor. The results reveal that, contrary to expectations, long-term and systematic harvesting reduces neither the future yields of fruit bodies nor the species richness of wild forest fungi, irrespective of whether the harvesting technique was picking or cutting. Forest floor trampling does, however, reduce fruit body numbers, but our data show no evidence that trampling damaged the soil mycelia in the studied time period.},

  abstract = {Microbial symbionts inhabit tissues of all plants and animals. Their community composition depends largely on two ecological processes: (1) filtering by abiotic conditions and host species determining the environments that symbionts are able to colonize and (2) dispersal-limitation determining the pool of symbionts available to colonize a given host and community spatial structure. In plants, the above- and belowground tissues represent such distinct habitats for symbionts that we expect different effects of filtering and spatial structuring on their symbiont communities. In this study, we characterized above- and belowground communities of fungal endophytes—fungi living asymptomatically within plants—to understand the contributions of filtering and spatial structure to endophyte community composition. We used a culture-based approach to characterize endophytes growing in leaves and roots of three species of coastal beachgrasses in dunes of the USA Pacific Northwest. For leaves, endophyte isolation frequency and OTU richness depended primarily on plant host species. In comparison, for roots, both isolation frequency and OTU richness increased from the nutrient-poor front of the dune to the higher-nutrient backdune. Endophyte community composition in leaves exhibited a distance-decay relationship across the region. In a laboratory assay, faster growth rates and lower spore production were more often associated with leaf- than root-inhabiting endophytes. Overall, our results reveal a greater importance of biotic filtering by host species and dispersal-limitation over regional geographic distances for aboveground leaf endophyte communities and stronger effects of abiotic environmental filtering and locally patchy distributions for belowground root endophyte communities.},

The potential of this species for revegetation of mine tailings under wetland conditions had not previously been investigated. In two outdoor experiments. G. fluitans of non-contaminated origin grew successfully on alkaline tailings containing elevated metal concentrations (230 μmol g−1 Zn, 11 μmol g−1 Pb). Growth of G. fluitans was significantly enhanced on tailings treated with NPK fertilizer (700 kg ha−1), but the plants grew well even without fertilizer, indicating a low nutrient requirement. Glyceria fluitans did not survive on saline (MgSO4) tailings originating from another mine that contained much higher lead (34 μmol g−1) and iron (2584 μmol g−1) concentrations. The ability of G. fluitans to tolerate many of the adverse conditions associated with mine tailings favors its use for revegetation purposes.},

  abstract = {Isolated wetlands are often degraded by agriculture, increasing sediment accretion and altering plant composition. Two common opposing wetland restoration practices are self-design vs. intensive revegetation. Self-design restores hydrogeomorphology without inoculating wetland taxa into restoration sites. Self-design may not meet restoration targets if dispersal-limited plants do not colonize restoration sites. Alternatively, intensive revegetation (hydrogeomorphic restoration combined with revegetation) is costly and time consuming. We investigated plant dispersal-limitation in 309 isolated wetlands among two agricultural landscapes in the U.S. Great Plains (the western High Plains (WHP) and the Rainwater Basin (RWB)) and three land-uses (reference, croplands, and previous croplands) to predict optimal restoration practices. We present analytical tools predicting whether self-design or intensive revegetation will be more successful elsewhere. In the WHP and RWB, perennial wetland cover was 61\% and 31\% greater in reference than in other land-uses. Distance to the nearest reference wetland explained perennial wetland richness in both regions, and area of reference wetlands within 15 km also was important in the WHP. Annual wetland species were over-represented in previous cropland wetlands and were less influenced by landscape isolation. We analytically identified dispersal-limited and cosmopolitan species in reference wetlands, with distance to reference wetlands and area of surrounding reference wetlands important in determining composition. Further, dispersal-limited plants in reference wetlands had greater cover in clustered than isolated wetlands in previous croplands. Plant community patterns in reference conditions may predict composition in restored wetlands. This aids selection of self-design or revegetation restoration approaches for individual plant species in isolated wetlands.},

  abstract = {Wild mushrooms are gaining more popularity among consumers. Commercial picking of mushrooms has increased in Finland, which can have an effect on forest management. Currently, mushrooms are considered a side-product of forestry, but understanding the factors affecting the variation in yields would enable the joint production of timber and mushrooms. This study aims to provide empirical models for predicting the annual yields of marketed mushrooms in planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands in eastern Finland. Separate models were fitted for Boletus edulis, Lactarius spp. and all marketed mushrooms. Mushroom data were inventoried from 56 sample plots for the period 2010–2014. Stand and annual climatic variables were used as predictors in the modelling. A non-linear mixed-effect modelling (NLMM) approach was used to account for between-plot and between-year variation in mushroom yields. The highest yields of B. edulis were obtained just before the first thinning phase of stand development (at the age of 25–30 years and the stand density of 25 m2/ha). The peak in the yields of Lactarius spp. and all marketed mushrooms was slightly later. The mushroom yields were promoted by a warm pre-season (in July) and wet conditions during the fruiting season (in August). In a good mushroom stand, the contribution of mushrooms to the total net present income (with a 3\% interest rate) during the entire rotation was 25\%. The results of this study enable the prediction of mushroom yields along with the development of spruce stands and thus support multiple-use planning and management of forests.},

  abstract = {Nutrient-rich freshwater ecosystems are generally considered as having low ecological quality and low associated biodiversity. In such systems we analysed the effects of water quality on biodiversity of several species groups, to determine tipping points and tools for monitoring. We investigated the water quality of 99 eutrophic and hypertrophic shallow lakes with extensive fish culture during a 3-year study, through the measures of physico-chemical parameters, phytoplankton biomass and structure. In a second step, we related the water quality with richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates and dragonflies. With concentrations of chlorophyll-a above 30 or 70 μg l−1, shallow lakes are normally classified, respectively, in a poor or bad ecological state. However, our results show that chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 78 μg l−1 could be found together with relatively high species or family richness of aquatic plants, invertebrates and dragonflies. We identified most tipping points with 50–60 μg l−1 of chlorophyll-a, values above which a significant decrease of species diversity was found. For monitoring of these shallow lakes we propose to use chlorophyll-a concentrations in combination with water transparency during spring. These parameters are easily applicable and cheap and they yield a good forecast of the biodiversity for the species groups studied.},

Short-term (60 and 42 days) incubations were conducted during fall 1998 and spring 1999. The effect of variable tissue nitrogen content on decomposition rates was evaluated by comparing mass loss among site-specific dominant species from each wetland. Effects of variable surface water and sediment nutrient concentrations on decomposition were assessed by measuring mass loss of standard litter materials (Typha latifolia and cellulose) of uniform C:N ratio. Decomposition of the site-specific dominant litter was significantly correlated with tissue C:N ratios and phosphorus concentrations in wetland waters and sediments. Water column and sediment phosphorus were also significant predictors of decomposition rates for the standard litter types. Nitrogen concentrations in surface waters were not significant predictors of decomposition for any of the substrates in either season. Wetlands impacted by mine drainage exhibited slower decomposition rates and lower nutrient levels in comparison to wetlands occurring in predominantly agricultural areas.},

An analysis of wetland mosaics was performed for two regions of the northeastern United States to assess the degree to which historical wetland loss alters the metrics of wetland mosaics and to assess potential future effects mediated by differently structured wetland regulations. These analyses indicated that profound reductions in wetland density and proximity are associated with increased human populations and that protections for all wetlands {$>$}1 acre (0.4 ha) are likely required to retain wetland densities minimally sufficient to sustain the wetland biota.

The perennial emergent sedge was found growing in acid waters (pH 2.45) and metal-rich tailings (SnAsCuPbZn). E. equisetina displayed a pronounced acid tolerance and tendency to exclude environmentally significant elements (Al, As, Cd, Ce, Co, Cu, Fe, La, Ni, Pb, Se, Th, U, Y, Zn) from its above-substrate biomass. This study demonstrates that geobotanical and biogeochemical examinations of wetland plants at abandoned mined lands of tropical areas can reveal pioneering, metal-excluding macrophytes. Such aquatic macrophytes are of potential use in the remediation of acid mine waters and sulfidic tailings and the reclamation of disturbed acid sulfate soils in subtropical and tropical regions.},

However, it is still unclear whether Phlebopus portentosus is a saprotrophic, parasitic, or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus. In this study, Phlebopus portentosus sporocarps were collected from northern Thailand and identified based on morphological and molecular characteristics. We combined mycorrhizal synthesis and stable isotopic analysis to investigate the trophic status of this fungus. In a greenhouse experiment, ECM-like structures were observed in Pinus kesiya at 1 year after inoculation with fungal mycelium, and the association of Phlebopus portentosus and other plant species showed superficial growth over the root surface. Fungus-colonized root tips were described morphologically and colonization confirmed by molecular methods. In stable isotope measurements, the δ13C and δ15N of natural samples of Phlebopus portentosus differed from saprotrophic fungi. Based on the isotopic patterns of Phlebopus portentosus and its ability to form ECM-like structures in greenhouse experiments, we conclude that Phlebopus portentosus could be an ECM fungus.},

In regions threatened by exotic species invasion and lacking native wild grazers, however, cattle may produce the type of disturbance that helps maintain diverse communities. Across 72 vernal pools, I examined the effect of different grazing treatments (ungrazed, continuously grazed, wet-season grazed and dry-season grazed) on vernal-pool plant and aquatic faunal diversity in the Central Valley of California. After 3 years of treatment, ungrazed pools had 88\% higher cover of exotic annual grasses and 47\% lower relative cover of native species than pools grazed at historical levels (continuously grazed). Species richness of native plants declined by 25\% and aquatic invertebrate richness was 28\% lower in the ungrazed compared with the continuously grazed treatments. Release from grazing reduced pool inundation period by 50 to 80\%, making it difficult for some vernal-pool endemic species to complete their life cycle. My results show that one should not assume livestock and ranching operations are necessarily damaging to native communities. In my central California study site, grazing helped maintain native plant and aquatic diversity in vernal pools.},

  abstract = {This assessment is based on reviews of the extent of wetland inventory in seven regions of the world. A key conclusion is that little is still known about the extent and condition of the global wetland resource. It was not possible to make reliable overall estimates of the size of the wetland resource globally or regionally. Previous estimates range from 5.3 to 9.7 million km\textsuperscript{2} but present analyses now suggest a tentative minimum of 12.8 km\textsuperscript{2}. Recommendations focus on the need for national inventory programmes and the inclusion of basic information on the location and extent of each wetland and its major ecological features as a forerunner to collecting further management-oriented information. Thus, the following core data should be collected: area and boundary, location, geomorphic setting, general description, soil characteristics, water regime, water quality, and biotic characteristics. Further, the development of standardized methods for data collection, collation and storage are called for. These should address the use of remotely sensed data and storage of information in electronic formats, including Geographic Information Systems and recording key information in a meta-database. Habitats of priority for future inventory are seagrasses, coral reefs, salt marshes and coastal flats, mangroves, arid-zone wetlands, peatlands, rivers and streams, and artificial wetlands.},

We tested the effectiveness of a plant community-based bioassessment tool, the floristic quality assessment index (FQAI) in 20 depressional wetlands in Ohio, USA. A priori, the 20 depressional wetlands were classified by type and ranked to form a disturbance gradient according to the local landscape condition. Ranks were based on surrounding land cover characteristics, vegetated buffer characteristics, and the extent of human-induced hydrologic alteration at the wetland site. The index was negatively correlated with the disturbance rank of a wetland and with the distance to neighboring wetlands (P = 0.01). Index values were lower for wetlands surrounded by agricultural or urban land use, wetlands with less vegetation on the wetland perimeter, and wetlands with more hydrologic modification, and at sites with greater distances to other wetlands. The wetlands with lower FQAI values tended to be dominated by plants that are typical of heavily cultivated landscapes or urban regions. Thus, the index is interpreted as a measure of environmental factors that maintain and control plant communities. The index was not correlated with differences in wetland surface water chemistry (α = 0.05) but was positively correlated with soil total organic carbon (P = 0.01), phosphorus (P = 0.05), and calcium (P = 0.05). Repeated wetland sampling in the summer and autumn revealed that the floristic quality assessment index could be useful for the assessment and monitoring of wetland ecosystems and for tracking wetland restoration projects over time.},

  abstract = {Despite their restricted surface area, small farmland ponds often have a high conservation value because they contribute significantly to regional biodiversity and contain rare or unique species. For this reason, the creation of new ponds has become a widely applied practice in many countries. Information on the effects of land use on farmland ponds is very scarce. Farmland ponds differ from larger ponds, lakes and rivers in many aspects and can therefore be expected to be affected by land use via other mechanisms operating at different spatial scales. We here present a study on 126 ponds distributed over the entire territory of Belgium (surface area: 30.500 km2). We assessed variables related to turbidity state and vegetation complexity and related them to land use variables assessed at several spatial scales ranging from the pond edge up to 32 km2 circular areas. According to redundancy analysis, trampling by cattle and percentage cover of nearby crop land were positively associated with turbid state related variables. Conversely, ponds with high coverage by forest in the immediate neighbourhood tended to be more associated with the clear water state. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a negative effect of trampling and coverage by crop land on vegetation complexity. Effects of crop lands and forest were strongest at the local scale ({$<$}200 m radius) which indicates that adverse external influences can most efficiently be mitigated at a small scale. Based on these results we suggest several recommendations for pond construction and conservation.},

Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we assessed how the richness of emergent macrophyte functional groups influences aboveground and belowground plant growth and microbial-mediated functions related to carbon and nitrogen cycling, with an emphasis on methane (CH₄) efflux and potential denitrification rates. We found that an increase in the richness of wetland plant functional groups enhanced belowground plant biomass, altered rooting patterns, and decreased methane efflux, while having no effect on aboveground plant production or denitrification potential. We hypothesize that the greater root production and increased rooting depth in the highest diversity treatments enhanced CH₄ oxidation to a relatively greater degree than methane production, leading to an overall decrease in CH₄ efflux across our plant functional group richness gradient.},

In an attempt to improve the understanding of the importance of this feature of wetlands an alternative classification of values is suggested; primary and secondary values. Primary value refers to the development and maintenance of ecosystems — their self-organizing capacity. Secondary values are defined as the outputs, life-support functions and services, generated by wetlands. Methods for measuring these values are discussed. Three case studies are presented which use different valuation methods and which to different degrees capture the primary and secondary values. It is concluded that only part of the total wetland value can be captured in monetary terms.},

To date, their occurrence and activity have mainly been studied in a small number of white-rot wood decomposers. However, peroxidase activity is commonly measured in boreal forest humus and mineral soils, in which ectomycorrhizal fungi predominate. Here, we used degenerate PCR primers to investigate whether peroxidase-encoding genes are present in the genomes of a wide phylogenetic range of ectomycorrhizal taxa. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products showed that ectomycorrhizal fungi from several different genera possess peroxidase genes. The new sequences represent four major homobasidiomycete lineages, but the majority is derived from Cortinarius, Russula and Lactarius. These genera are ecologically important, but consist mainly of non-culturable species from which little ecophysiological information is available. The amplified sequences contain conserved active sites, both for folding and substrate oxidation. In some Cortinarius spp., there is evidence for gene duplications during the evolution of the genus. ClassII peroxidases seem to be an ancient and a common feature of most homobasidiomycetes, including ectomycorrhizal fungi. Production of extracellular peroxidases may provide ectomycorrhizal fungi with access to nitrogen sequestered in complex polyphenolic sources.},

  abstract = {Information about the relative biodiversity value of different waterbody types is a vital pre-requisite for many strategic conservation goals. In practice, however, exceptionally few inter-waterbody comparisons have been made. The current study compared river, stream, ditch and pond biodiversity within an 80 km2 area of lowland British countryside. The results showed that although all waterbody types contributed to the diversity of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates in the region, they differed in relative value. Individual river sites were rich but relatively uniform in their species composition. Individual ponds varied considerably in species richness, with the richest sites supporting similar numbers of taxa to the best river sections, but the poorest sites amongst the most impoverished for all waterbody types. At a regional level, however, ponds contributed most to biodiversity, supporting considerably more species, more unique species and more scarce species than other waterbody types. Streams typically supported fewer species and fewer unique species at local and regional level than either ponds or rivers. Ditches (most of which were seasonal) were the least species-rich habitat, but supported uncommon species, including temporary water invertebrates not recorded in other waterbody types. Multivariate analysis indicated that permanence, depth, flow and altitude were the main environmental variables explaining invertebrate and plant assemblage composition. The findings, as a whole, suggest that ponds and other small waterbodies can contribute significantly to regional biodiversity. This contrasts markedly with their relative status in national monitoring and protection strategies, where small waterbodies are largely ignored.},

  abstract = {“One-to-many” mutualisms are often observed in nature. In this type of mutualism, each host individual can interact with many symbionts, whereas each individual symbiont can interact with only one host individual. Partner choice by the host is a potentially critical mechanism for maintaining such systems; however, its long-term effects on the coevolution between the hosts and symbionts have not been completely explored. In this study, I developed a simple mathematical model to describe the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and symbionts in a one-to-many mutualism. I assumed that each host chooses a constant number of symbionts from a potential symbiont population, a fraction of which are chosen through preferential choice on the basis of the cooperativeness of the symbionts and the rest are chosen randomly. Using numerical calculations, I found that mutualism is maintained when the preferential choice is not very costly and the mutation rate of symbionts is large. I also found that symbionts that receive benefits from hosts without a return (cheater symbionts) and hosts that do not engage in preferential partner choice (indiscriminator hosts) can coexist with mutualist symbionts and discriminator hosts, respectively. The parameter domain of pure mutualism, i.e., free from cheater symbionts and indiscriminator hosts, can be narrower than the whole domain where the mutualism persists.},

To respond to the need for planning tools for multiple-use forestry, we developed empirical models for predicting the production of wild mushrooms in pine forests in the South-Central Pyrenees using forest stand and site characteristics as predictors. Mushroom production and species richness data from 45 plots were used. A mixed modelling technique was used to account for between-plot and between-year variation in the mushroom production data.

  abstract = {A baseline survey of macroinvertebrate populations in two mine-water treatment wetlands, one treating a net acidic spoil heap discharge and one a net alkaline ferruginous pumped mine water, was undertaken to assess the potential of these systems to provide habitats for faunal communities. Both wetlands were found to be impoverished in comparison to natural wetlands but did sustain a macroinvertebrate community that could support higher organisms. Wetland size and water quality in terms of pH, conductivity and metal concentrations were found to be important factors in determining the quality of the populations supported. Direct toxicity to organisms was unlikely to be the main cause of lower diversity, but the smothering of organisms via the precipitation of iron hydroxides particularly in the early parts of the treatment systems affected macroinvertebrate communities. The presence of areas of open water within the planted systems was found to be important for providing habitats for macroinvertebrates and this should be both a future design and maintenance consideration for environmental managers.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that changes in community compositions of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi along elevation gradients are mainly affected by changes in host tree communities and/or in abiotic environments. However, few studies have taken the effects of processes related to fungal dispersal (i.e., spatial processes) into account and distinguished the effects of host community, abiotic environment, and spatial processes on community composition along elevation gradients. This has left unclear the relative importance of these factors in structuring the ECM community assemblages. To address this, we investigated the community composition of ECM fungi along an elevation gradient in northern Japan with 454 meta-barcoding. We found that the community composition of ECM fungi changed along the elevation and that all three factors jointly affected the compositional changes. We separated the magnitude of importance of the three factors in structuring ECM fungal communities and found that most part of the spatial variation in ECM fungal community was explained by host communities and abiotic environments. Our results suggest that while biotic and/or abiotic environments can be important factors to determine the ECM fungal community composition along an elevation gradient, spatial processes may also be a primary determinant for the ECM fungal community composition.},

  abstract = {Candida metapsilosis is a rarely-isolated, opportunistic pathogen that belongs to a clade of pathogenic yeasts known as the C. parapsilosis sensu lato species complex. To gain insight into the recent evolution of C. metapsilosis and the genetic basis of its virulence, we sequenced the genome of 11 clinical isolates from various locations, which we compared to each other and to the available genomes of the two remaining members of the complex: C. orthopsilosis and C. parapsilosis. Unexpectedly, we found compelling genomic evidence that C. metapsilosis is a highly heterozygous hybrid species, with all sequenced clinical strains resulting from the same past hybridization event involving two parental lineages that were approximately 4.5\% divergent in sequence. This result indicates that the parental species are non-pathogenic, but that hybridization between them formed a new opportunistic pathogen, C. metapsilosis, that has achieved a worldwide distribution. We show that these hybrids are diploid and we identified strains carrying loci for both alternative mating types, which supports mating as the initial mechanism for hybrid formation. We trace the aftermath of this hybridization at the genomic level, and reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the different strains. Recombination and introgression -resulting in loss of heterozygosis- between the two subgenomes have been rampant, and includes the partial overwriting of the MTLa mating locus in all strains. Collectively, our results shed light on the recent genomic evolution within the C. parapsilosis sensu lato complex, and argue for a re-definition of species within this clade, with at least five distinct homozygous lineages, some of which having the ability to form hybrids.},

Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These losses were due primarily to forestry and agriculture. Other sources of cumulative impact include decrease in average area of individual wetlands, shift in proportion of wetland types, change in spatial configuration of wetlands, and loss of cumulative wetland function at the landscape scale. For two wetland-related functions, flood flow and loading of suspended solids, watersheds that contained less than 10\% wetlands were more sensitive to incremental loss of wetland area than were watersheds with more than 10\% wetlands. The relative position of wetlands within a drainage network also influenced their cumulative function. Georgraphic Information Systems (GIS) are becoming an important tool for evaluating cumulative impacts and their effects.},

While these man-made ponds are not intended to serve as freshwater ecosystems, it is becoming clear that they do provide habitat for many organisms, but we know little of their ecosystem structure, function and interactions with pollutants. From April through June 2009, we surveyed 8 stormwater ponds in the Red Run Watershed, Baltimore County, Maryland, USA to describe patterns in aquatic food webs associated with a gradient in road salt inputs. Periphyton, phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were collected from each pond every 4–6 weeks. Specific conductance, a measure of chloride salt loading, among the 8 ponds varied widely throughout the survey, ranging from 99 μS cm−1 to 19,320 μS cm−1. Low (average = 404 +/− 82.6 (SE) μS cm−1) and medium (average = 1749 +/− 267 (SE) μS cm−1) conductance ponds had lower algal biomass and higher densities of zooplankton taxa relative to high (average = 7231 +/− 2143 (SE) μS cm−1) conductance ponds, which were largely devoid of all zooplankton through the end of May. The observed decline in zooplankton density along an increasing chloride gradient is consistent with experimental results of road deicer effects, suggesting algal resources are possibly freed from grazing pressure as zooplankton consumers are negatively impacted by road salt exposure. Our results highlight the potential for both direct and indirect effects of road deicers on freshwater communities.},

Detailed comparisons of one high-flow and one low-flow wetland at 16 sample sites in each wetland twice the solar efficiency in the high-flow wetland (0.6 vs. 0.3\%). Depth profiles indicated that the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased by as much as 60\% from 15 cm below the water's surface to 50 cm below.

  abstract = {* Eutrophication remains a major stress for freshwater biodiversity. Its deleterious consequences on biodiversity are well documented for large waterbodies. However, the impact of eutrophication may differ in smaller waterbodies, such as ponds and small lakes, which generally support naturally high levels of nutrients in lowlands. Furthermore, this response could depend on the scale considered, from local (individual waterbody, alpha diversity) to regional (the network of waterbodies, gamma diversity). It is also unclear whether the richness of threatened species responds in the same way as the richness of the whole assemblage.

* The present study investigates local- and regional-scale consequences of eutrophication on taxonomic richness (all taxa) and conservation value (threatened taxa) in temperate lowland small waterbodies. Five taxonomic groups were investigated: macrophytes, gastropods, water beetles, adult dragonflies and amphibians, in a set of natural waterbodies and a set of enriched waterbodies covering a large nutrient gradient from mesotrophic to hypertrophic conditions.

* Globally, our study did not reveal consistent, systematic responses to eutrophication. For macrophytes, the richness and conservation value suffered from eutrophication at both local and regional scales. In contrast, for amphibians and gastropods, eutrophication did not impair biodiversity at the local nor the regional scale. Dragonflies and water beetles showed intermediate situations, with an impairment by eutrophication varying according to the type of waterbodies considered. At the regional scale, each trophic status, even the nutrient richest, brought an original contribution to biodiversity.

* Synthesis and applications. The management of eutrophication for small lowland waterbodies has to be considered differently than for lakes. For an individual waterbody (the local scale), nutrient enrichment is not necessarily a major impairment and its impact depends on the taxonomic group considered. Conversely, at the landscape scale, eutrophication is a major pressure on small waterbody biodiversity, especially because nutrient-rich small waterbodies are dominant in the landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts should integrate the notion of pond regional networks or ‘pondscapes’, where the regional biodiversity is supported by a mosaic of trophic conditions, and promote the presence of less rich waterbodies.},

  abstract = {Agaricomycetes, the mushrooms, are considered to have a promiscuous mating system, because most populations have a large number of mating types. This diversity of mating types ensures a high outcrossing efficiency, the probability of encountering a compatible mate when mating at random, because nearly every homokaryotic genotype is compatible with every other. Here I summarize the data from mating type surveys and genetic analysis of mating type loci and ask what evolutionary and ecological factors have promoted promiscuity. Outcrossing efficiency is equally high in both bipolar and tetrapolar species with a median value of 0.967 in Agaricomycetes. The sessile nature of the homokaryotic mycelium coupled with frequent long distance dispersal could account for selection favoring a high outcrossing efficiency as opportunities for choosing mates may be minimal. Consistent with a role of mating type in mediating cytoplasmic-nuclear genomic conflict, Agaricomycetes have evolved away from a haploid yeast phase towards hyphal fusions that display reciprocal nuclear migration after mating rather than cytoplasmic fusion. Importantly, the evolution of this mating behavior is precisely timed with the onset of diversification of mating type alleles at the pheromone/receptor mating type loci that are known to control reciprocal nuclear migration during mating. While reciprocal nuclear exchange may have released some of the restrictions on the evolution of multiple mating types, it may also have fostered a nuclear “arms race” that favored the evolution of selfish alleles with greater access to conspecific mycelia. Such selection could potentially increase mating type diversity through rapid diversification of novel, more fully compatible forms or may actually reduce outcrossing efficiency by skewing mating type allele frequencies towards more selfish alleles. Distinguishing among the possible mechanisms involved in promoting promiscuity will require extensive testing of correlates between allele number and cytological, ecological, and demographic factors across a broad range of species.},

  abstract = {The spatial insurance hypothesis predicts that intermediate rates of dispersal between patches in a metacommunity allow species to track favourable conditions, preserving diversity and stabilizing biomass at local and regional scales. However, theory is unclear as to whether dispersal will provide spatial insurance when environmental conditions are changing directionally. In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2°C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.},

One class of such models is based on the idea that seed size determines competitive ability, seed number determines colonization ability, and the two traits are negatively correlated such that higher competitive ability of large-seeded species compensates for their smaller seed number. According to such models, species inhabiting the same community should show a distinct ranking of competitive ability and this ranking should be correlated with seed size. We tested these predictions using a greenhouse competition experiment focusing on 25 annual species that coexist in sandy habitats of the Mediterranean region in Israel. Rankings of species based on their competitive effects on two independent phytometers were positively correlated. Corresponding rankings based on competitive responses were also correlated. Rankings based on competitive effects were correlated with those based on competitive responses. Yet, in spite of the clear hierarchy in all measures of competitive ability, none of the measures was correlated with seed size. While lack of correlation between seed size and competitive ability has been documented in some systems, our study is the first time that absence of such correlation is documented in a system where the existence of competition is well established and the component species show a clear hierarchy of competitive ability.},

* In three bioassay experiments, we tested the role of vertical soil heterogeneity in determining the distributions and competitive outcomes of the EM sister species Rhizopogon vinicolor and Rhizopogon vesiculosus. We planted Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings into soils that were either a homogenized mix of upper and lower depths or vertically stratified combinations mimicking natural field conditions.

* We found that both species colonized the upper or lower soil depths in the absence of competition, suggesting that their distributions were not limited by abiotic edaphic factors. In competition within homogeneous soils, R.~vesiculosus completely excluded colonization by R.~vinicolor, but R.~vinicolor was able to persist when soils were stratified. The amount of colonization by R.~vinicolor in the stratified soils was also significantly correlated with the number of multilocus genotypes present.

* Taken together, our findings suggest that the differential vertical distributions of R.~vinicolor and R.~vesiculosus in natural settings are probably attributable to competition rather than edaphic specialization, but that soil heterogeneity may play a key role in promoting EM fungal diversity.},

  abstract = {Millions of tons of fungal spores are dispersed in the atmosphere every year. These living cells, along with plant spores and pollen grains, may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds. Basidiospores released by mushrooms form a significant proportion of these aerosols, particularly above tropical forests. Mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes. Our research heightens interest in the global significance of the fungi and raises additional concerns about the sustainability of forests that depend on heavy precipitation.},

To track forest floor decomposer activity we generated metatranscriptomes that simultaneously surveyed the actively expressed bacterial and eukaryote genes in the forest floor, to compare the impact of N deposition on the decomposers in two natural maple forests in Michigan, USA, where replicate field plots had been amended with N for 16 years. Site and N amendment responses were compared using about 74,000 carbohydrate active enzyme transcript sequences (CAZymes) in each metatranscriptome. Parallel ribosomal RNA (rRNA) surveys of bacterial and fungal biomass and taxonomic composition showed no significant differences in either biomass or OTU richness between the two sites or in response to N. Site and N amendment were not significant variables defining bacterial taxonomic composition, but they were significant for fungal community composition, explaining 17 and 14\% of the variability, respectively. The relative abundance of expressed bacterial and fungal CAZymes changed significantly with N amendment in one of the forests, and N-response trends were also identified in the second forest. Although the two ambient forests were similar in community biomass, taxonomic structure and active CAZyme profile, the shifts in active CAZyme profiles in response to N-amendment differed between the sites. One site responded with an over-expression of bacterial CAZymes, and the other site responded with an over-expression of both fungal and different bacterial CAZymes. Both sites showed reduced representation of fungal lignocellulose degrading enzymes in N-amendment plots. The metatranscriptome approach provided a holistic assessment of eukaryote and bacterial gene expression and is applicable to other systems where eukaryotes and bacteria interact.},

For bacteria, active communities were significantly more clustered than dormant communities, while the reverse was found for fungi. The proportion of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as active and the degree of phylogenetic clustering of the active bacterial communities declined with increasing pH and decreasing C/N. No significant correlations were found for the fungal community.

Whole metagenome sequencing (WMG) obtains information on functional genes, but it is costly and inefficient due to large amount of sequencing that is required. In this study, we have applied a captured metagenomics technique for functional genes in soil microorganisms, as an alternative to WMG. Large-scale targeting of functional genes, coding for enzymes related to organic matter degradation, was applied to two agricultural soil communities through captured metagenomics. Captured metagenomics uses custom-designed, hybridization-based oligonucleotide probes that enrich functional genes of interest in metagenomic libraries where only probe-bound DNA fragments are sequenced. The captured metagenomes were highly enriched with targeted genes while maintaining their target diversity and their taxonomic distribution correlated well with the traditional ribosomal sequencing. The captured metagenomes were highly enriched with genes related to organic matter degradation; at least five times more than similar, publicly available soil WMG projects. This target enrichment technique also preserves the functional representation of the soils, thereby facilitating comparative metagenomics projects. Here, we present the first study that applies the captured metagenomics approach in large scale, and this novel method allows deep investigations of central ecosystem processes by studying functional gene abundances.},

  abstract = {Arid shrublands are stressful environments, typified by alkaline soils low in organic matter, with biologically-limiting extremes in water availability, temperature, and UV radiation. The widely-spaced plants and interspace biological soil crusts in these regions provide soil nutrients in a localized fashion, creating a mosaic pattern of plant- or crust-associated microhabitats with distinct nutrient composition. With sporadic and limited rainfall, nutrients are primarily retained in the shallow surface soil, patterning biological activity. We examined soil bacterial and fungal community responses to simulated nitrogen (N) deposition in an arid Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa field experiment in southern Nevada, USA, using high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal RNA genes. To examine potential interactions among the N application, microhabitat and soil depth, we sampled soils associated with shrub canopies and interspace biological crusts at two soil depths (0–0.5 or 0–10 cm) across the N-amendment gradient (0, 7, and 15 kg ha−1 yr−1). We hypothesized that localized compositional differences in soil microbiota would constrain the impacts of N addition to a microhabitat distribution that would reflect highly localized geochemical conditions and microbial community composition. The richness and community composition of both bacterial and fungal communities differed significantly by microhabitat and with soil depth in each microhabitat. Only bacterial communities exhibited significant responses to the N addition. Community composition correlated with microhabitat and depth differences in soil geochemical features. Given the distinct roles of soil bacteria and fungi in major nutrient cycles, the resilience of fungi and sensitivity of bacteria to N amendments suggests that increased N input predicted for many arid ecosystems could shift nutrient cycling toward pathways driven primarily by fungal communities.},

No significant interactions between N and CO2 were observed, but individual effects of N and CO2 were found. Elevated CO2 resulted in changes in phylogenetic similarity, and a shift to phylogenetic clustering of AMF communities. N addition resulted in higher phylogenetic diversity and evenness, with no shifts in community composition and no significant signal for phylogenetic clustering. N addition resulted in an increase in both available N and the N:P ratio in N-amended plots, which suggests that changing patterns of nutrient limitation could have lead to altered species interactions.

We used the highly parallel microarray technology GeoChip 4.0, which contains 83~992 probes specific for genes linked nutrient cycling and other processes, to evaluate how the diversity, abundance and similarity of the targeted genes responded to forest-to-pasture conversion. We also evaluated whether these parameters were reestablished with secondary forest growth. A spatially nested scheme was employed to sample a primary forest, two pastures (6 and 38~years old) and a secondary forest. Both pastures had significantly lower microbial functional genes richness and diversity when compared to the primary forest. Gene composition and turnover were also significantly modified with land use change. Edaphic traits associated with soil acidity, iron availability, soil texture and organic matter concentration were correlated with these gene changes. Although primary and secondary forests showed similar functional gene richness and diversity, there were differences in gene composition and turnover, suggesting that community recovery was not complete in the secondary forest. Gene association analysis revealed that response to ecosystem conversion varied significantly across functional gene groups, with genes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling mostly altered. This study indicates that diversity and abundance of numerous environmentally important genes respond to forest-to-pasture conversion and hence have the potential to affect the related processes at an ecosystem scale.},

  abstract = {Micro-organisms play critical roles in many important biogeochemical processes in the Earth's biosphere. However, understanding and characterizing the functional capacity of microbial communities are still difficult due to the extremely diverse and often uncultivable nature of most micro-organisms. In this study, we developed a new functional gene array, GeoChip 4, for analysing the functional diversity, composition, structure, metabolic potential/activity and dynamics of microbial communities. GeoChip 4 contained approximately 82~000 probes covering 141~995 coding sequences from 410 functional gene families related to microbial carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulphur (S), and phosphorus (P) cycling, energy metabolism, antibiotic resistance, metal resistance/reduction, organic remediation, stress responses, bacteriophage and virulence. A total of 173 archaeal, 4138 bacterial, 404 eukaryotic and 252 viral strains were targeted, providing the ability to analyse targeted functional gene families of micro-organisms included in all four domains. Experimental assessment using different amounts of DNA suggested that as little as 500~ng environmental DNA was required for good hybridization, and the signal intensities detected were well correlated with the DNA amount used. GeoChip 4 was then applied to study the effect of long-term warming on soil microbial communities at a Central Oklahoma site, with results indicating that microbial communities respond to long-term warming by enriching carbon degradation, nutrient cycling (nitrogen and phosphorous) and stress response gene families. To the best of our knowledge, GeoChip 4 is the most comprehensive functional gene array for microbial community analysis.},

  abstract = {Elucidating the connection between genotype, phenotype, and adaptation in wild populations is fundamental to the study of evolutionary biology, yet it remains an elusive goal, particularly for microscopic taxa, which comprise the majority of life. Even for microbes that can be reliably found in the wild, defining the boundaries of their populations and discovering ecologically relevant phenotypes has proved extremely difficult. Here, we have circumvented these issues in the microbial eukaryote Neurospora crassa by using a “reverse-ecology” population genomic approach that is free of a priori assumptions about candidate adaptive alleles. We performed Illumina whole-transcriptome sequencing of 48 individuals to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms. From these data, we discovered two cryptic and recently diverged populations, one in the tropical Caribbean basin and the other endemic to subtropical Louisiana. We conducted high-resolution scans for chromosomal regions of extreme divergence between these populations and found two such genomic “islands.” Through growth-rate assays, we found that the subtropical Louisiana population has a higher fitness at low temperature (10 °C) and that several of the genes within these distinct regions have functions related to the response to cold temperature. These results suggest the divergence islands may be the result of local adaptation to the 9 °C difference in average yearly minimum temperature between these two populations. Remarkably, another of the genes identified using this unbiased, whole-genome approach is the well-known circadian oscillator frequency, suggesting that the 2.4°–10.6° difference in latitude between the populations may be another important environmental parameter.},

  abstract = {Fungi do not have different sexes characterized by specific morphological organs but control sexual development by physiological differences defined by mating types. While other lineages in the fungal kingdom have only two distinct mating types, multiple mating types are common in the Basidiomycetes, presumably for outcomes related to enhanced outbreeding. Mating types in Basidiomycetes are determined by genes that encode two types of homeodomain transcription factors (HD genes) and by genes that encode lipopeptide pheromones and pheromone receptors (PR genes). In the tetrapolar mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea, these genes reside at two distinct loci on different chromosomes and regulate distinct steps in dikaryon formation and maintenance and fruiting body formation for sexual reproduction by controlling the expression of large sets of genes. The matA (HD) locus in C. cinerea has an estimated 160 alleles in nature, and the matB (PR) locus has 79. The respective products of both loci interact with each other in a lock-and-key manner. Proteins encoded in allelic sets of mating type genes recognize each other and interact in order to either form a functional transcription factor complex that is transported into the nucleus (matA proteins) or to initiate a pheromone response signaling cascade (matB proteins). Products encoded by the same matA or matB allele do not interact, which is crucial to the functionality of the two systems controlling sexual development. Multiple alleles of mating type genes arose in evolution through the evolution of distinct DNA sequences and the resulting encoded proteins perform the tasks of recognition and discrimination. In a second modus of multiplication, paralogous sets of HD and PR genes evolved by gene duplications and subsequent sequence diversification in order to mediate functional independency and respective allele variation. In C. cinerea, there are thus three paralogous groups of functional mating type genes at both the matA and the matB locus. Because groups of paralogous genes are freely interchangeable, only a few alleles of each of the actual gene groups (between 2 and 9 are known per group) are required to generate the large number of distinct matA and matB mating types found in nature. As deduced from the ever increasing number of genome projects, the basic principles of evolution of multiple mating types as unraveled in C. cinerea by Lorna A. Casselton and her coworkers are to different degrees also operative in other mushroom species.},

We inferred diversity patterns, phylogenetic structures and divergence times of Sebacinales with respect to their nutritional lifestyles by integrating data from fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analyses. Relaxed molecular clock analyses indicated that Sebacinales originated late Permian within Basidiomycota, and their split into Sebacinaceae and Serendipitaceae  nom .  prov . likely occurred during the late Jurassic and the early Cretaceous, coinciding with major diversifications of land plants. In Sebacinaceae, diversification of species with ectomycorrhizal lifestyle presumably started during the Paleocene. Lineage radiations of the core group of ericoid and cavendishioid mycorrhizal Sebacinales started probably in the Eocene, coinciding with diversification events of their hosts. The diversification of Sebacinales with jungermannioid interactions started during the Oligocene, and occurred much later than the diversification of their hosts. Sebacinales communities associated either with ectomycorrhizal plants, achlorophyllous orchids, ericoid and cavendishioid Ericaceae or liverworts were phylogenetically clustered and globally distributed. Major Sebacinales lineage diversifications started after the continents had drifted apart. We also briefly discuss dispersal patterns of extant Sebacinales.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in global ecology is the identification of key functional processes in ecosystems that scale, but do not require, data for individual species across landscapes. Given that nearly all tree species form symbiotic relationships with one of two types of mycorrhizal fungi—arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi—and that AM- and ECM-dominated forests often have distinct nutrient economies, the detection and mapping of mycorrhizae over large areas could provide valuable insights about fundamental ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling, species interactions, and overall forest productivity. We explored remotely sensed tree canopy spectral properties to detect underlying mycorrhizal association across a gradient of AM- and ECM-dominated forest plots. Statistical mining of reflectance, reflectance derivatives, and band differencing across moderate/high-resolution Landsat data revealed distinctly unique phenological signals that differentiated AM- and ECM-associations. This approach was trained and validated against measurements of tree species and mycorrhizal association across 140,000 trees throughout the temperate US. We were able to predict 77\% of the variation in mycorrhizal association distribution within the forest plots (p{$<$}0.001). The implications for this work move us towards mapping mycorrhizal association globally and advancing our understanding of biogeochemical cycling and other ecosystem processes.

These changes in strategies are observed at the community level, but whether they also occur within individual species remains unknown. Plant species forming multiple root symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, and nitrogen-(N) fixing microorganisms provide valuable model systems to examine edaphic controls on symbioses related to nutrient acquisition, while simultaneously controlling for plant host identity. We grew two co-occurring species, Acacia rostellifera (N2-fixing and dual AM and ECM symbioses) and Melaleuca systena (AM and ECM dual symbioses), in three soils of contrasting ages (c. 0.1, 1, and 120~ka) collected along a long-term dune chronosequence in southwestern Australia. The soils differ in the type and strength of nutrient limitation, with primary productivity being limited by N (0.1~ka), co-limited by N and phosphorus (P) (1~ka), and by P (120~ka). We hypothesized that (i) within-species root colonization shifts from AM to ECM with increasing soil age, and that (ii) nodulation declines with increasing soil age, reflecting the shift from N to P limitation along the chronosequence. In both species, we observed a shift from AM to ECM root colonization with increasing soil age. In addition, nodulation in A.~rostellifera declined with increasing soil age, consistent with a shift from N to P limitation. Shifts from AM to ECM root colonization reflect strengthening P limitation and an increasing proportion of total soil P in organic forms in older soils. This might occur because ECM fungi can access organic P via extracellular phosphatases, while AM fungi do not use organic P. Our results show that plants can shift their resource allocation to different root symbionts depending on nutrient availability during ecosystem development.},

Therefore, understanding the processes by which whole root-associated microbiomes are organized is one of the major challenges in ecology and plant science. We here report that diverse root-associated fungi can form highly compartmentalized networks of coexistence within host roots and that the structure of the fungal symbiont communities can be partitioned into semi-discrete types even within a single host plant population. Illumina sequencing of root-associated fungi in a monodominant south beech forest revealed that the network representing symbiont–symbiont co-occurrence patterns was compartmentalized into clear modules, which consisted of diverse functional groups of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. Consequently, terminal roots of the plant were colonized by either of the two largest fungal species sets (represented by Oidiodendron or Cenococcum). Thus, species-rich root microbiomes can have alternative community structures, as recently shown in the relationships between human gut microbiome type (i.e. ‘enterotype’) and host individual health. This study also shows an analytical framework for pinpointing network hubs in symbiont–symbiont networks, leading to the working hypothesis that a small number of microbial species organize the overall root–microbiome dynamics.},

A series of molecular studies has demonstrated that C. geophilum is monophyletic but a heterogeneous species or a species complex. Here, we revisit the phylogenetic diversity of C. geophilum sensu lato from a regional to intercontinental scale by using new data from Florida (USA) along with existing data in GenBank from Japan, Europe, and North America. The combination of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene resolved six well-supported lineages (87–100 \% bootstrap values) that are closely related to each other and a seventh lineage that is phylogenetically distinct. A multi-locus analysis (small subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), translational elongation factor (TEF), and the largest and second-largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2)) revealed that the divergent lineage is the sister group to all other known Cenococcum isolates. Isolates of the divergent lineage grow fast on nutrient media and do not form ectomycorrhizas on seedlings of several pine and oak species. Our results indicate that C. geophilum sensu lato includes more phylogenetically distinct cryptic species than have previously been reported. Furthermore, the divergent lineage appears to be a non-mycorrhizal sister group. We discuss the phylogenetic diversity of C. geophilum sensu lato and argue in favor of species recognition based on phylogenetic and ecological information in addition to morphological characteristics. A new genus and species (Pseudocenococcum floridanum gen. et sp. nov.) is proposed to accommodate a divergent and putatively non-mycorrhizal lineage.},

Here we tested Illumina metabarcoding, a method that generates shorter reads but achieves deeper sequencing than 454 metabarcoding approaches. We found that paired-end Illumina MiSeq data cover the full ITS1 in many fungal lineages and are suitable for environmental fungal community assessment. There was substantial read loss during data cleanup (78.6\%), which, however, did not impede the analyses, because of the large number of initial sequences (over 4Mio). We observed a high stochasticity in individual PCR reactions. Comparing three repeated sets of PCRs products showed that 58.5\% of the total fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found were not recovered by any single set of PCR reactions. Similarly, comparing three annealing temperatures showed that 63.6\% of all fungal OTUs were not recovered using any single annealing temperature. These findings suggest that sampling of soil fungal communities is more exhaustive, if we combine repeated PCR products, and PCR products generated at various annealing temperatures. To analyze the above issues we sampled 16 soil cores along a 270~cm transect in a meadow. In total we recovered 3320 fungal OTUs (based on a 95\% similarity threshold). Distance decay analysis indicated that community similarity decreased slightly with geographical distance.},

  abstract = {Soil fungal communities in tropical regions remain poorly understood. In order to increase the knowledge of diversity of soil-inhabiting fungi, we extracted total DNA from top-organic soil collected in seven localities dominated by four major ecosystems in the tropical island of Puerto Rico. In order to comprehensively characterize the fungal community, we PCR-amplified the ITS2 fungal barcode using newly designed degenerated primers and varying annealing temperatures to minimize primer bias. Sequencing results, obtained using Ion Torrent technology, comprised a total of 566,613 sequences after quality filtering. These sequences were clustered into 4,140 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) after removing low frequency sequences and rarefaction to account for differences in read depth between samples. Our results demonstrate that soil fungal communities in Puerto Rico are structured by ecosystem. Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, dominates the diversity of fungi in soil. Amongst Ascomycota, the recently described soil-inhabiting class Archaeorhizomycetes was present in all the localities and taxa in this class were among the most commonly observed MOTUs. The Basidiomycota community was dominated by soil decomposers and ectomycorrhizal fungi with a distribution strongly affected by local variation to a greater degree than Ascomycota.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic diversity in environmental samples is often assessed via PCR-based amplification of nSSU genes. However, estimates of diversity derived from pyrosequencing environmental data sets are often inflated, mainly because of the formation of chimeric sequences during PCR amplification. Chimeras are hybrid products composed of distinct parental sequences that can lead to the misinterpretation of diversity estimates. We have analyzed the effect of sample richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity on the formation of chimeras using a nSSU data set derived from 454 Roche pyrosequencing of replicated, large control pools of closely and distantly related nematode mock communities, of known intragenomic identity and richness. To further investigate how chimeric molecules are formed, the nSSU gene secondary structure was analyzed in several individuals. For the first time in eukaryotes, chimera formation proved to be higher in both richer and more genetically diverse samples, thus providing a novel perspective of chimera formation in pyrosequenced environmental data sets. Findings contribute to a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms involved in chimera formation during PCR amplification of environmentally derived DNA. Moreover, given the similarities between biodiversity analyses using amplicon sequencing and those used to assess genomic variation, our findings have potential broad application for identifying genetic variation in homologous loci or multigene families in general.},

  abstract = {Although soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in delivering various ecosystem functions and services, we are only beginning to understand how microbial communities are shaped by various soil physical properties and environmental factors. In this study, we integrate metabarcoding of bacteria and fungi and soil physical measurements at 60 locations on a 15 × 15 m grid in an agricultural field to: (1) characterize the spatial variation of microbial richness and diversity, and (2) identify the soil physical parameters that are most strongly correlated with them. The study field is located in Silstrup Denmark, extends over 1.69 ha, and slopes 1–2° to the north. Soil samples for 454-pyrosequencing were extracted by pushing 50-mL sterilized plastic vials into the soil. Bulk soil samples were used for the measurement of pH, organic carbon, and soil texture. Intact 100 cm3 soil cores, collected in triplicate, were used for measuring the soil water characteristic curve. Across the field, bacterial richness (number of OTUs) and diversity indices (Shannon diversity and phylogenetic diversity) showed strong spatial autocorrelations. Fungal number of OTUs was quite similar over the field and thus no spatial autocorrelation was observed for them. Fungal Shannon diversity slightly increased from south to north, with spatial autocorrelation for distances larger than 100 m. The ratio of clay to organic carbon (n) was found to be the best predictor of bacterial richness and diversity indices. Neither organic carbon nor clay content was significantly correlated with fungal richness and diversity indices. For soil structural parameters, soil water retention in the pF range 5–6.8 (parameter B) was significantly correlated with both bacterial and fungal Shannon diversities. Amount of macropores (\&gt; 30 μm) and total porosity (ϕ) were only significantly correlated with fungal Shannon diversity. These results suggest that variation in microbial communities is not random but strongly related with variations in organic carbon, clay content, and soil water characteristics at the field scale.},

  abstract = {The sustainable use of the soil resource requires extensive knowledge about its genesis, morphology, and properties. Consequently, soil data are basis for improved land use management and soil conservation. The present study illustrates morphology and physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of the soils developed in the pediplain of Central Benin. The pediments are characterized by different substrate layers, whereas the material of valleys and the surroundings of inselbergs are of colluvial origin. Termites also play an important role in tropical soils by influencing soil properties. Movement of clay and sesquioxides are typical pedogenetic processes, resulting in the formation of horizons enriched with clay or of ferricrete. The soils of the study site are classified as Sols ferrugineux tropicaux lessivés, Sols hydromorphes, Sols minéraux bruts, and Sols bruns, according to the French Classification des Sols, as Alfisols, Inceptisols, or Entisols according to the U.S.D.A. Soil Taxonomy, or as Acrisols, Plinthosols, Gleysols, Fluvisols, Leptsols, and Cambisols according to the classification systems of the FAO-UNESCO legend and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. The assessment of soil shows that the fertility of the pediment soils is generally low due to the low amount of organic matter, nutrients and poor water holding capacity of the sandy topsoil. The loamy soils surrounding the inselberg as well as the areas influenced by termites are more fertile because of a higher amount of nutrients and better water holding capacity.},

  abstract = {Theories of causality in ecology and evolution rarely lend themselves to analysis by the formal method of "hypothesis testing" envisioned by champions of a "strong inference" model of scientific method. The objective of biological research typically is to assess the relative contributions of a number of potential causal agents operating simultaneously. Sensibly stated hypotheses in the methodology of most field investigations are similar to hypotheses of applied statistics. They are not intended to be mutually exclusive, in any sense exhaustive, or global in their application. It is not possible in principle to perform a "critical test" or experiment to distinguish between the truth of "alternative hypotheses" if the proposed causal processes they caricature occur simultaneously. We consider several examples in which a rigid hypothetico-deductive methodology applied to nonalternative ecological "hypotheses" could lead to fallacious conclusions. It has been proposed that processes of ecological succession may be separated into alternative modes of "facilitation," "inhibition," and "tolerance." Yet attempts to experimentally reject one or more of the supposedly distinct hypotheses cannot, in principle, distinguish between them in a variety of biologically interesting cases. In studies of the limits of distributions of intertidal organisms, reasonable univariate experimental tests of possible causes would lead to rejection of "biological enemy" hypotheses when a "keystone predator effect" occurs because the interaction between competition and predation reverses the direction of the effect on some prey populations expected from either process in isolation. Particular problems arise when "null models" in ecology are treated as hypotheses of "strong inference." Models of ecological or evolutionary causality rarely have single or easily stated "null" converses. Tractable null models have no probability of being strictly true, and thus may be rejected a priori as hypothetico-deductive constructs. In practice, their role is as a reference point for measurement of departures. Their usefulness in this regard depends upon the reliability with which the characteristics of biology without interaction can be estimated. Applied to studies of interspecific competition through the use of species distributions, purported null hypotheses make different biological assumptions than those of the interactive models. They seem neither especially more reliable nor in any way more fundamental. We see no reason to accept the recent claims that "null hypotheses," as applied in ecology and evolution, have any logical primacy or greater parsimony than other approaches to partitioning the variation observed in natural communities among the contributions of many observable causes. Careful consideration of possible explanations and controlled experimentation contribute a great deal to ecological and evolutionary knowledge. However, we believe that the hypothetico-deductive model of scientific method can provide misleading prescriptions for efficient investigation and acceptance of evidence in phenomena with multiple causes, and should be applied with appropriate skepticism.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is a widespread plant nutrition strategy in Australia, especially in semiarid regions. This study aims to determine the diversity, community structure and host preference of ECM fungi in a Tasmanian wet sclerophyll forest. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were identified based on anatomotyping and rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-large subunit (LSU) sequence analysis using taxon-specific primers. Host tree roots were identified based on root morphology and length differences of the chloroplast trnL region. A total of 123 species of ECM fungi were recovered from root tips of Eucalyptus regnans (Myrtaceae), Pomaderris apetala (Rhamnaceae) and Nothofagus cunninghamii (Nothofagaceae). The frequency of two thirds of the most common ECM fungi from several lineages was significantly influenced by host species. The lineages of Cortinarius, Tomentella-Thelephora, Russula-Lactarius, Clavulina, Descolea and Laccaria prevailed in the total community and their species richness and relative abundance did not differ by host species. This study demonstrates that strongly host-preferring, though not directly specific, ECM fungi may dominate the below-ground community. Apart from the richness of Descolea, Tulasnella and Helotiales and the lack of Suillus-Rhizopogon and Amphinema-Tylospora, the ECM fungal diversity and phylogenetic community structure is similar to that in the Holarctic realm.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest amongst community ecologists in functional traits. Response traits determine membership in communities. Effect traits influence ecosystem function. One goal of community ecology is to predict the effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Environmental change can directly and indirectly affect ecosystem function. Indirect effects are mediated through shifts in community structure. It is difficult to predict how environmental change will affect ecosystem function via the indirect route when the change in effect trait distribution is not predictable from the change in response trait distribution. When response traits function as effect traits, however, it becomes possible to predict the indirect effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Here we illustrate four examples in which key attributes of ectomycorrhizal fungi function as both response and effect traits. While plant ecologists have discussed response and effect traits in the context of community structuring and ecosystem function, this approach has not been applied to ectomycorrhizal fungi. This is unfortunate because of the large effects of ectomycorrhizal fungi on ecosystem function. We hope to stimulate further research in this area in the hope of better predicting the ecosystem- and landscape-level effects of the fungi as influenced by changing environmental conditions.},

Though science had taken up the challenge to relate these traits to functions in the 20th century, such deliberations became much rarer in recent decades. In the review presented here we aim at reviving this research area, particularly in regard to ecological implications. We have therefore compiled fruit body traits with their evidenced or suggested functions. Some traits have no immediate functional meaning, but many are suggestive of some ecological importance. Many traits serve more than one function, and traits interact in the sense of trade-offs, patterns that reflect the economy of fungal design. In conclusion, the review comes up with well and little-known mushroom properties, and the numerous gaps in attributing traits to functions.},

We provide a methodology for EIVs and an EIV list for nearly 650 species of macromycetes. We propose a new EIV scale, namely substrate openness (O). We also give the results of two applications and compare EIV values related to the Red List classification with those related to lifestyle classification. Mycorrhizal species on average have higher demands on substrate openness and are less tolerant of high nutrient levels than saprotrophic or parasitic species. Critically endangered species have on average distinctly higher demands on openness of habitat and substrate than not threatened or less strongly threatened species, which in turn have higher demands for nutrient availability. This pattern clearly highlights the points of threat for many macromycete species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.},

There are two parametrization for the presented model, one using the common Dirichlet distribution’s α parameters, and a reparametrization of the αs to set up a mean–and–dispersion-like model. By applying appropriate link-functions, a GLM-like framework is set up that allows for the analysis of such data in a straightforward and familiar way, because interpretation is similar to multinomial logistic regression. This paper gives a brief theoretical foundation and describes the implementation as well as application (including worked examples) of Dirichlet regression methods implemented in the package DirichletReg (Maier, 2013) in the R language (R Core Team, 2013).},

The progression of processes in such systems usually involves check-points and events at which the relationships between the components are altered in response to stimuli. Detecting these events together with the implicated components can help understand the temporal aspects of complex biological systems. Here we propose a regularized regression-based approach for identifying breakpoints and corresponding segments from multivariate time-series data. In combination with techniques from clustering, the approach also allows estimating the significance of the determined breakpoints as well as the key components implicated in the emergence of the breakpoints. Comparative analysis with the existing alternatives demonstrates the power of the approach to identify biologically meaningful breakpoints in diverse time-resolved transcriptomics data sets from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.},

  abstract = {By altering the dynamics of DNA replication and repair, alternative ploidy states may experience different rates and types of new mutations, leading to divergent evolutionary outcomes. We report the first direct comparison of the genome-wide spectrum of spontaneous mutations arising in haploid and diploid forms of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Characterizing the number, types, locations, and effects of thousands of mutations revealed that haploids were more prone to single-nucleotide and mitochondrial mutations, while larger structural changes were more common in diploids. Mutations were more likely to be detrimental in diploids, even after accounting for the large impact of structural changes, contrary to the prediction that diploidy masks the effects of recessive alleles. Haploidy is expected to reduce the opportunity for conservative DNA repair involving homologous chromosomes, increasing the insertion-deletion rate, but we found little support for this idea. Instead, haploids were more susceptible to particular single-nucleotide mutations in late-replicating genomic regions, resulting in a ploidy difference in the spectrum of substitutions. In diploids we detect mutation rate variation among chromosomes in association with centromere location, a finding that is supported by published polymorphism data. Diploids are not simply doubled haploids; instead, our results predict that the spectrum of spontaneous mutations will substantially shape the dynamics of genome evolution in haploid and diploid populations.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary transitions require the organization of genetic variation at two (or more) levels of selection so that fitness heritability may emerge at the new level. In this article, we consider the consequences for fitness variation and heritability of two of the main modes of reproduction used in multicellular organisms: vegetative reproduction and single-cell reproduction. We study a model where simple cell colonies reproduce by fragments or propagules of differing size, with mutations occurring during colony growth. Mutations are deleterious at the colony level but can be advantageous or deleterious at the cell level (“selfish” or “uniformly deleterious” mutants). Fragment size affects fitness in two ways: through a direct effect on adult group size (which in turn affects fitness) and by affecting the within- and between-group variances and opportunity for selection on mutations at the two levels. We show that the evolution of fragment size is determined primarily by its direct effects on group size except when mutations are selfish. When mutations are selfish, smaller propagule size may be selected, including singlecell reproduction, even though smaller propagule size has a direct fitness cost by virtue of producing smaller organisms, that is, smaller adult cell groups.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Termitomyces mushrooms are mutualistically associated with fungus-growing termites, which are widely considered to cultivate a monogenotypic Termitomyces symbiont within a colony. Termitomyces cultures iso‑lated directly from termite colonies are heterokaryotic, likely through mating between compatible homokaryons.
Results:\hspace{0.6em} After pairing homokaryons carrying different haplotypes at marker gene loci MIP and RCB from a Termitomyces fruiting body associated with Odontotermes formosanus, we observed nuclear fusion and division, which greatly resembled meiosis, during each hyphal cell division and conidial formation in the resulting heterokaryons. Surpris‑ingly, nuclei in homokaryons also behaved similarly. To confirm if meiotic-like recombination occurred within mycelia, we constructed whole-genome sequencing libraries from mycelia of two homokaryons and a heterokaryon resulting from mating of the two homokaryons. Obtained reads were aligned to the reference genome of Termitomyces sp. J132 for haplotype reconstruction. After removal of the recombinant haplotypes shared between the heterokaryon and either homokaryons, we inferred that 5.04\% of the haplotypes from the heterokaryon were the recombinants result‑ing from homologous recombination distributed genome-wide. With RNA transcripts of four meiosis-specific genes, including SPO11, DMC1, MSH4, and MLH1, detected from a mycelial sample by real-time quantitative PCR, the nuclear behavior in mycelia was reconfirmed meiotic-like.
Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Unlike other basidiomycetes where sex is largely restricted to basidia, Termitomyces maximizes sexuality at somatic stage, resulting in an ever-changing genotype composed of a myriad of coexisting heterogeneous nuclei in a heterokaryon. Somatic meiotic-like recombination may endow Termitomyces with agility to cope with termite consumption by maximized genetic variability.},

In this outdoor inoculation experiment, we assessed the virulence of six haploid Armillaria ostoyae strains along with their diploid parent towards 2-year-old seedlings and 4-year-old saplings of Norway spruce (Picea abies), and determined their ability to colonise freshly cut stumps. As inoculum source an Armillaria-colonised hazelnut (Corylus avellana) stem segment was inserted into the soil substrate. Re-isolations from mycelial fans at the root collar of infected trees or stumps were made. Surprisingly, not a single haploid re-isolate could be recovered. Microsatellite genotyping of 133 re-isolates suggests that the inoculated haploid strains were diploidised either by mating propagules (basidiospores or haploid mycelia) already present in the soil substrate or naturally disseminated in the course of the experiment from nearby forests. Consequently, no conclusion about the infectious ability of haploid Armillaria mycelia under natural conditions can be drawn. Nonetheless, the diploid half-sib families resulting from the diploidisation showed varying degrees of virulence, with a high correlation between the experiment with 2-year-old seedlings and 4-year-old saplings. Despite extensive genotyping of re-isolates, no evidence for somatic recombination between haploid mating propagules and diploidised mycelia was detected, suggesting that this is an uncommon phenomenon in A. ostoyae.},

  abstract = {The many different mechanisms that fungi use to transmit and share genetic material are mediated by a broad range of chromosome and nuclear dynamics. The mechanics underlying nuclear migration are well integrated into detailed models, in which the forces supplied by plus- and minus-end-directed microtubule motors position and move the nucleus in a cell. Although we know much about how cells move nuclei, we know much less about why the cell invests in so many different nuclear ‘dances’. Here, we briefly survey the available models for the mechanics of nuclear migration in fungi and then focus on examples of how fungal cells use these nuclear dances — the movement of intact nuclei in and between cells — to control the integrity, ploidy and assortment of specific genomes or individual chromosomes.},

We propose a definition based instead on the evolutionary criteria of alignment of fitness, export of fitness by germ-soma specialization, and adaptive functional organization. We consider how these concepts apply to various putative individual organisms. We conclude that complex multicellular organisms and colonies of eusocial insects satisfy these three criteria, but that, in most cases (with at least one notable exception), colonies of modular organisms and genetic chimeras do not. While species do not meet these criteria, they may meet the criteria for a broader concept—that of an evolutionary individual—and sexual reproduction may be a species-level exaptation for enhancing evolvability. We also review the costs and benefits of internal genetic heterogeneity within putative individuals, demonstrating that high relatedness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for individuality, and that, in some cases, genetic variability may have adaptive benefits at the level of the whole.},

  abstract = {The dikaryon is the persistent vegetative phase of most basidiomycetes and arises by cell fusion of two haploids carrying different mating type alleles. The diplophase is restricted to a single cell (the basidium) where meiosis takes place. Cell fusion and karyogamy are thus temporally and spatially separated. The dikaryon is characterized by the presence in each cell of two genetically distinct nuclei in a 1:1 ratio and by clamp connections, structures involved in partitioning of the nuclei during their synchronous division. In Coprinopsis cinerea and Schizophyllum commune, with two mating type loci (A and B), heterokaryons with identical A alleles exhibit nuclear migration but no clamps, and those with identical B alleles have unfused clamps (pseudoclamps) and no nuclear migration. Armillaria species are exceptional among basidiomycetes because of their persistent vegetative diploid phase with no clamp connections. Cell fusion is followed immediately by karyogamy. Haploidization of the diploid nucleus may occur in the fruiting body, resulting in a new dikaryophaseediplophase. Diploids in Ustilago maydis were the first to be synthesized in any basidiomycete. They played a critical role in pioneering studies on DNA recombination and repair. Subsequently diploids were generated in C. cinerea, S. commune, Microbotryum violaceum, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Dikaryons (or heterokaryons) and diploids of the same genotype exhibit phenotypic differences. The reason is not known but evidence indicates that gene expression differs when the same genetic information resides in two nuclei versus one nucleus in the same cell. Diploids in basidiomycete fungi are very stable by themselves but become unstable in 2N þ N or 2N þ 2N dikaryons. Instability results in haploidization (gradual loss of chromosomes) of the diploid nucleus. The mechanism that triggers this instability is not known.},

Previous work has shown that an extension restricted to non-overlapping inversions can be solved in O(n 3) with a restricted scoring scheme. In this paper, we show that the alignment problem extended to non-overlapping moves can be solved in O(n 5) for general scoring schemes, O(n 4log n) for concave scoring schemes and O(n 4) for restricted scoring schemes. Furthermore, we show that the alignment problem extended to non-overlapping moves, inversions and tandem duplications can be solved with the same time complexities.

We define an expanded space of axis labelings by automatically generating additional nice numbers as needed and by permitting the extreme labels to occur inside the data range. These changes provide flexibility in problematic cases, without degrading quality elsewhere. We also propose an additional optimization criterion, legibility, which allows us to simultaneously optimize over label formatting, font size, and orientation. To solve this revised optimization problem, we describe the optimization function and an efficient search algorithm. Finally, we compare our method to previous work using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This paper is a good example of how ideas from automated graphic design can be applied to information visualization.},

Prominent among ancient asexual lineages are the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a group of plant symbionts with a multinucleate cytoplasm. Genomic divergence among co-existing nuclei was proposed to drive the evolutionary success of AMF in the absence of sex1, but this hypothesis has been contradicted by recent genome analyses that failed to find significant genetic diversity within an AMF isolate2,3. Here, we set out to resolve issues surrounding the genome organization and sexual potential of AMF by exploring the genomes of five isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis, a model AMF. We find that genetic diversity in this species varies among isolates and is structured in a homo-dikaryon-like manner usually linked with the existence of a sexual life cycle. We also identify a putative AMF mating-type locus, containing two genes with structural and evolutionary similarities with the mating-type locus of some Dikarya. Our analyses suggest that this locus may be multi-allelic and that AMF could be heterothallic and bipolar. These findings reconcile opposing views on the genome organization of these ubiquitous plant symbionts and open avenues for strain improvement and environmental application of these organisms.},

  abstract = {Summary. Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

Understanding the processes that regulate soil respiration is critical for predicting future climate. Recent work has suggested that soil carbon respiration may be reduced by competition for nitrogen between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that associate with plant roots and free‐living microbial decomposers, which is consistent with increased soil carbon storage in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems globally. However, experimental tests of the mycorrhizal competition hypothesis are lacking. Here we show that ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae decrease soil carbon respiration rates by up to 67\% under field conditions in two separate field exclusion experiments, and this likely occurs via competition for soil nitrogen, an effect larger than 2 °C soil warming. These findings support mycorrhizal competition for nitrogen as an independent driver of soil carbon balance and demonstrate the need to understand microbial community interactions to predict ecosystem feedbacks to global climate.},

Here, we combine a further study of the genetic structure of L. amethystina populations from Europe to southwestern China and Japan, using neutral Single Sequence Repeat (SSR; microsatellite) markers; and a systematic description of two novel Asian species, namely Laccaria moshuijun and Laccaria japonica, based on ecological, morphological, and molecular criteria (rDNA sequences). Population genetics provides evidence of the ancient isolation of three regional groups, with strong signal for speciation, and suggests a centre of origin of modern populations closest to present-day Chinese populations. Phylogenetic analyses confirm speciation at the molecular level, reflected in morphological features: L. moshuijun samples (from Yunnan, China) display strongly variable cheilocystidia, while L. japonica samples (from Japan) present distinctive globose to subglobose spores and clavate cheilocystidia. This study of a species complex primarily described with an extremely wide ecological and geographical range sheds new light on the biodiversity and biogeography of ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

  abstract = {Microbial ecology has made large advances over the last decade, mostly because of improvements in molecular analysis techniques that have enabled the detection and identification of progressively larger numbers of microbial species. However, determining the ecological patterns and processes taking place in communities of microbes remains a significant challenge. Are communities randomly assembled through dispersal and priority effects, or do species interact with each other leading to positive and negative associations? For mycorrhizal fungi, evidence is accumulating that stochastic and competitive interactions between species may both have a role in shaping community structure. Could the methodological approach, which is often incidence based, impact the outcomes detected? Here, we applied an incidence-based Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) database approach to examine species diversity and ecological interactions within a community of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that the ECM community colonizing root tips was strongly structured by competitive interactions, or ecological processes generating a similar spatial pattern, rather than neutral processes. Analysis of b-diversity indicated that community structure was significantly more similar (spatially autocorrelated) at distances equal to or {$<$}3.41 m. The eight most frequently encountered species in the root tip community of ECM fungi displayed significant competitive interactions with at least one other species, showing that the incidence-based approach was capable of detecting this sort of ecological information.},

Little is currently known about the drivers of fungal population differentiation and subsequent divergence of species, particularly in symbiotic, mycorrhizal fungi. Here, we investigate the population structure and environmental adaptation in Suillus brevipes (Peck) Kuntze, a wind-dispersed soil fungus that is symbiotic with pine trees. We assembled and annotated the reference genome for Su. brevipes and resequenced the whole genomes of 28 individuals from coastal and montane sites in California. We detected two clearly delineated coast and mountain populations with very low divergence. Genomic divergence was restricted to few regions, including a region of extreme divergence containing a gene encoding for a membrane Na+/H+ exchanger known for enhancing salt tolerance in plants and yeast. Our results are consistent with a very recent split between the montane and coastal Su. brevipes populations, with few small genomic regions under positive selection and a pattern of dispersal and/or establishment limitation. Furthermore, we identify a putatively adaptive gene that motivates further functional analyses to link genotypes and phenotypes and shed light on the genetic basis of adaptive traits.},

The remaining genotype comprised 13 basidiomes and covered an area of at least 300 m2, with maximum measured dimensions of 40 m and 14 m. This is the largest genet of an ectomycorrhizal fungus described to date, and is likely the result of vegetative growth, because analysis of single spore isolates eliminates the possibility of genetic identity resulting from either apomixis or fortuitously indistinguishable recombinant genotypes. Genetic analysis also shows that although out-crossing appears to predominate in the population, at least a low percentage (1-4 \%) of spores are secondarily homothallic.},

  abstract = {DNA barcoding is an efficient method to identify specimens and to detect undescribed/cryptic species. Sanger sequencing of individual specimens is the standard approach in generating large-scale DNA barcode libraries and identifying unknowns. However, the Sanger sequencing technology is, in some respects, inferior to next-generation sequencers, which are capable of producing millions of sequence reads simultaneously. Additionally, direct Sanger sequencing of DNA barcode amplicons, as practiced in most DNA barcoding procedures, is hampered by the need for relatively high-target amplicon yield, coamplification of nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, confusion with sequences from intracellular endosymbiotic bacteria (e.g. Wolbachia) and instances of intraindividual variability (i.e. heteroplasmy). Any of these situations can lead to failed Sanger sequencing attempts or ambiguity of the generated DNA barcodes. Here, we demonstrate the potential application of next-generation sequencing platforms for parallel acquisition of DNA barcode sequences from hundreds of specimens simultaneously. To facilitate retrieval of sequences obtained from individual specimens, we tag individual specimens during PCR amplification using unique 10-mer oligonucleotides attached to DNA barcoding PCR primers. We employ 454 pyrosequencing to recover full-length DNA barcodes of 190 specimens using 12.5\% capacity of a 454 sequencing run (i.e. two lanes of a 16 lane run). We obtained an average of 143 sequence reads for each individual specimen. The sequences produced are fulllength DNA barcodes for all but one of the included specimens. In a subset of samples, we also detected Wolbachia, nontarget species, and heteroplasmic sequences. Next-generation sequencing is of great value because of its protocol simplicity, greatly reduced cost per barcode read, faster throughout and added information content.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular approaches and DNA sequencing have greatly progressed the field of ecology and allowed for the study of complex communities in unprecedented detail. Next generation sequencing (NGS) can reveal powerful insights into the diversity, composition, and dynamics of cryptic organisms, but results may be sensitive to a number of technical factors, including molecular practices used to generate amplicons, sequencing technology, and data processing. Despite the popularity of some techniques over others, explicit tests of the relative benefits they convey in molecular ecology studies remain scarce. Here we tested the effects of PCR replication, sequencing depth, and sequencing platform on ecological inference drawn from environmental samples of soil fungi. We sequenced replicates of three soil samples taken from pine biomes in North America represented by pools of either one, two, four, eight, or sixteen PCR replicates with both 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina MiSeq. Increasing the number of pooled PCR replicates had no detectable effect on measures of a- and b-diversity. Pseudo-b-diversity – which we define as dissimilarity between re-sequenced replicates of the same sample – decreased markedly with increasing sampling depth. The total richness recovered with Illumina was significantly higher than with 454, but measures of a- and b-diversity between a larger set of fungal samples sequenced on both platforms were highly correlated. Our results suggest that molecular ecology studies will benefit more from investing in robust sequencing technologies than from replicating PCRs. This study also demonstrates the potential for continuous integration of older datasets with newer technology.},

  abstract = {The high polysaccharide content of some plant species hinders the successful isolation of their DNA. As an alternative to the macro-extraction methods previously published for polysaccharide-rich plants, we present two techniques (STE/CTAB and HEPES/CTAB), which are performed in microcentrifuge tubes. These protocols are suitable for small amounts of silica gel-preserved plant tissue such as are commonly available from endangered plants. The critical step to remove polysaccharides was performing initial washes in either STE (0.25 M sucrose, 0.03 M Tris, 0.05 M EDTA) or HEPES (2\% b-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\% PVP, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 8.0) buffer. Precipitating the DNA at room temperature with isopropanol also aided in decreasing polysaccharide co-precipitation. Of the two protocols we present the STE/CTAB method has the advantages of being more cost-effective and avoiding the use of the hazardous chemical b-mercaptoethanol.},

Tests with both recent ({$<$}2 year) and older ({$>$}100 years) specimens reveal that older collections have low success rates and may be an inefficient resource for populating a barcode database. However, our method of extracting DNA from herbarium samples using small amount of tissue is reliable and could be used for important historical specimens. The application of these protocols greatly reduces time, and therefore cost, of generating DNA sequences from mushrooms and other fungi vs. traditional extraction methods. The efficiency of these methods illustrates that standardization and streamlining of sample processing should be shifted from the laboratory to the field.},

  abstract = {Background: When samples are collected in the field and transported to the lab, degradation of the nucleic acids contained in the samples is frequently observed. Immediate extraction and precipitation of the nucleic acids reduces degradation to a minimum, thus preserving accurate sequence information. An extraction method to obtain high quality DNA in field studies is described. Findings: DNA extracted immediately after sampling was compared to DNA extracted after allowing the sampled tissues to air dry at 21°C for 48 or 72 hours. While DNA extracted from fresh tissues exhibited little degradation, DNA extracted from all tissues exposed to 21°C air for 48 or 72 hours exhibited varying degrees of degradation. Yield was higher for extractions from fresh tissues in most cases. Four microcentrifuges were compared for DNA yield: one standard electric laboratory microcentrifuge (max rcf = 16,000×g), two battery-operated microcentrifuges (max rcf = 5,000 and 3,000 ×g), and one manually-operated microcentrifuge (max rcf = 120×g). Yields for all centrifuges were similar. DNA extracted under simulated field conditions was similar in yield and quality to DNA extracted in the laboratory using the same equipment. Conclusions: This CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) DNA extraction method employs battery-operated and manually-operated equipment to isolate high quality DNA in the field. The method was tested on plant and fungus tissues, and may be adapted for other types of organisms. The method produced high quality DNA in laboratory tests and under simulated field conditions. The field extraction method should prove useful for working in remote sites, where ice, dry ice, and liquid nitrogen are unavailable; where degradation is likely to occur due to the long distances between the sample site and the laboratory; and in instances where other DNA preservation and transportation methods have been unsuccessful. It may be possible to adapt this method for genomic, metagenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic projects using samples collected in situ.},

Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of the most commonly applied “open-format” and “closed-format” detection technologies. We discuss their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages within the context of environmental applications and focus on analysis of complex microbial systems, such as those in soils, in which diversity is high and reference genomes are few. In addition, we discuss crucial issues and considerations associated with applying complementary high-throughput molecular technologies to address important ecological questions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radioactive DNA polymerase activity methods are cumbersome and do not provide initial extension rates. A simple extension rate assay would enable study of basic assumptions about PCR and define the limits of rapid PCR.
METHODS: A continuous assay that monitors DNA polymerase extension using noncovalent DNA dyes on common real-time PCR instruments was developed. Extension rates were measured in nucleotides per second per molecule of polymerase. To initiate the reaction, a nucleotide analog was heat activated at 95 °C for 5 min, the temperature decreased to 75 °C, and fluorescence monitored until substrate exhaustion in 30 –90 min.
RESULTS: The assay was linear with time for over 40\% of the reaction and for polymerase concentrations over a 100-fold range (1–100 pmol/L). Extension rates decreased continuously with increasing monovalent cation concentrations (lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, and ammonium). Melting-temperature depressors had variable effects. DMSO increased rates up to 33\%, whereas glycerol had little effect. Betaine, formamide, and 1,2propanediol decreased rates with increasing concentrations. Four common noncovalent DNA dyes inhibited polymerase extension. Heat-activated nucleotide analogs were 92\% activated after 5 min, and hot start DNA polymerases were 73\%–90\% activated after 20 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Simple DNA extension rate assays can be performed on real-time PCR instruments. Activity is decreased by monovalent cations, DNA dyes, and most melting temperature depressors. Rational inclusion of PCR components on the basis of their effects on polymerase extension is likely to be useful in PCR, particularly rapid-cycle or fast PCR.},

Double-stranded DNA formation during extension of a hairpin substrate was monitored at 75 °C for 2 min. Rates were determined in nucleotides per second per molecule of polymerase (nt/s) and were linear with time and polymerase concentration from 1 to 50 nM. The concentrations of 15 available polymerases were quantified and their extension rates determined in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 200 lM each dNTP as well as their commercially recommended buffers. Native Taq polymerases had similar extension rates of 10–45 nt/s. Three alternative polymerases showed faster speeds, including KOD (76 nt/s), Klentaq I (101 nt/s), and KAPA2G (155 nt/s). Fusion polymerases including Herculase II and Phusion were relatively slow (3–13 nt/s). The pH optimum for Klentaq extension was between 8.5 and 8.7 with no effect of Tris concentration. Activity was directly correlated to the MgCl2 concentration and inversely correlated to the KCl concentration. This continuous assay is relevant to PCR and provides accurate measurement of polymerase activity using a defined template without the need of radiolabeled substrates.},

  abstract = {PCR is a formidable and potent technology that serves as an indispensable tool in a wide range of biological disciplines. However, due to the ease of use and often lack of rigorous standards many PCR applications can lead to highly variable, inaccurate, and ultimately meaningless results. Thus, rigorous method validation must precede its broad adoption to any new application. Multi-template samples possess particular features, which make their PCR analysis prone to artifacts and biases: multiple homologous templates present in copy numbers that vary within several orders of magnitude. Such conditions are a breeding ground for chimeras and heteroduplexes. Differences in template amplification efficiencies and template competition for reaction compounds undermine correct preservation of the original template ratio. In addition, the presence of inhibitors aggravates all of the above-mentioned problems. Inhibitors might also have ambivalent effects on the different templates within the same sample. Yet, no standard approaches exist for monitoring inhibitory effects in multitemplate PCR, which is crucial for establishing compatibility between samples.},

In particular, the enzymatic reactions and DNA purification steps during library preparation can result in DNA template loss and sequencing biases, affecting downstream analyses.

  abstract = {Fruiting body formation in Agaricomycetes (Agaricomycotina) represents the most complex developmental processes known in the fungal kingdom. Shapes range from simple resupinate forms with open hymenia through to closed puff-balls and false truffles with internally hidden hymenia and include brackets and stiped mushrooms, which may have open caps throughout or which open during development, where the hymenia cover the surfaces of gills or pores. Mushroom shapes and features do not necessarily reflect close or distant phylogenetic relationships. Thus, morphological characteristics have lost some of their former significance in taxonomy. The onset and progress of courses of processes in mushroom formation are determined by the sum of various genetic, physiological and environmental factors. Shapes of mushrooms can be dramatically changed by mutations and by adverse environmental conditions. Events in normal fruiting body formation may run in parallel or behind each other in the form of ‘subroutines’ that have different degrees of independency to each other. Alterations in details or in places and orders of distinct subroutines and omissions can result in abnormal mushrooms. Developmental processes, time courses and tissue structures have been described in more details for a few model species (such as the hemiangiocarpous Coprinopsis cinerea and the gymnocarpous Schizophyllum commune) and some species of commercial interest (e.g. the gymnocarpous Auricularia auricula-judae and the hemiangiocarpous Agaricus bisporus). Morphological descriptions of fruiting body development in these four species are summarized here. Agaricomycetes have relatively large genomes with more than 10,000 different genes, many of which are expressed during the fruiting process in specific pseudoparenchymatous tissues (plectenchyma) or possibly only in individual cells within a tissue and at specific times. To understand the distinct functions of all these genes in space and time will require very fine dissection and analysis of distinct mushroom tissues and cells in future studies.},

  abstract = {Exploring the link between above- and belowground biodiversity has been a major theme of recent ecological research, due in large part to the increasingly well-recognized role that soil microorganisms play in driving plant community processes. In this study, we utilized a fieldbased tree experiment in Minnesota, USA to assess the effect of changes in plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity on the richness and composition of both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities. We found that ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness was significantly positively influenced by increasing plant phylogenetic diversity, while saprotrophic fungal species richness was significantly affected by plant leaf nitrogen content, specific root length, and standing biomass. The increasing ectomycorrhizal fungal richness associated with increasing plant phylogenetic diversity was driven by the combined presence of ectomycorrhizal fungal specialists in plots with both gymnosperm and angiosperm hosts. Although the species composition of both the ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungal communities changed significantly in response to changes in plant species composition, the effect was much greater for ectomycorrhizal fungi. In addition, ectomycorrhizal but not saprotrophic fungal species composition was significantly influenced by both plant phylum (angiosperm, gymnosperm, both) and origin (Europe, America, both). While the phylum effect was driven by differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition, the origin effect was driven by differences in community heterogeneity. Taken together, this study emphasizes the guild-specific nature of plant-associated effects on soil fungal communities and provides a mechanistic basis for the positive link between plant phylogenetic diversity and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness.},

We analyzed the taxonomic composition and function of microbiomes inhabiting fungal fruiting-bodies in relation to host genetic variation, soil pH and geographic distance between samples. For this, we sequenced the metagenomes of 40 fruiting-bodies collected from six fairy rings (i.e. genets) of a saprotrophic fungus Marasmius oreades. Our analyses revealed that fine genetic variations between host fungi could strongly affect their associated microbiome, explaining respectively 25\% and 37\% of the variation in microbiome structure and function, whereas geographic distance and soil pH remained of secondary importance. These results, together with the smaller genome size of fungi compared to other eukaryotes, suggest that fruiting-bodies are suitable for further genomic centric studies on host-microbiome interactions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of the ability to distinguish self from nonself (allorecognition) and mechanisms underlying evolution of allorecognition systems is an important endeavor for understanding cases where it becomes dysfunctional, such as in autoimmune disorders. In filamentous fungi, allorecognition can result in vegetative or heterokaryon incompatibility, which is a type of programmed cell death that occurs following fusion of genetically different cells. Allorecognition is genetically controlled by het loci, with coexpression of any combination of incompatible alleles triggering vegetative incompatibility. Herein, we identified, characterized, and inferred the evolutionary history of candidate het loci in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. As characterized het loci encode proteins carrying an HET domain, we annotated HET domain genes in 25 isolates from a natural population along with the N. crassa reference genome using resequencing data. Because allorecognition systems can be affected by frequency-dependent selection favoring rare alleles (i.e., balancing selection), we mined resequencing data for HET domain loci whose alleles displayed elevated levels of variability, excess of intermediate frequency alleles, and deep gene genealogies. From these analyses, 34 HET domain loci were identified as likely to be under balancing selection. Using transformation, incompatibility assays and genetic analyses, we determined that one of these candidates functioned as a het locus (het-e). The het-e locus has three divergent allelic groups that showed signatures of positive selection, intra- and intergroup recombination, and trans-species polymorphism. Our findings represent a compelling case of balancing selection functioning on multiple alleles across multiple loci potentially involved in allorecognition.},

We show how the total variance of Y can be calculated either directly or through a dissimilarity matrix obtained using any dissimilarity index deemed appropriate for pairwise comparisons of community composition data. We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and ANOVA. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and amonggroup components by MANOVA, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

  title = {Just {{Another Gibbs Additive Modeller}}: {{Interfacing JAGS}} and Mgcv},
  abstract = {The BUGS language offers a very flexible way of specifying complex statistical models for the purposes of Gibbs sampling, while its JAGS variant offers very convenient R integration via the rjags package. However, including smoothers in JAGS models can involve some quite tedious coding, especially for multivariate or adaptive smoothers. Further, if an additive smooth structure is required then some care is needed, in order to centre smooths appropriately, and to find appropriate starting values. R package mgcv implements a wide range of smoothers, all in a manner appropriate for inclusion in JAGS code, and automates centring and other smooth setup tasks. The purpose of this note is to describe an interface between mgcv and JAGS, based around an R function, jagam, which takes a generalized additive model (GAM) as specified in mgcv and automatically generates the JAGS model code and data required for inference about the model via Gibbs sampling. Although the auto-generated JAGS code can be run as is, the expectation is that the user would wish to modify it in order to add complex stochastic model components readily specified in JAGS. A simple interface is also provided for visualisation and further inference about the estimated smooth components using standard mgcv functionality. The methods described here will be un-necessarily inefficient if all that is required is fully Bayesian inference about a standard GAM, rather than the full flexibility of JAGS. In that case the BayesX package would be more efficient.},

The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.},

The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental designs.},

We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over- or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements.

This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of actual forests.},

The method of Freedman \& Lane (1983) is found to have asymptotic correlation 1 with the exact test, and the other methods are found to have smaller correlations with this test. Under local alternatives the critical values of all the approximate permutation tests converge to the same constant, so they all have the same asymptotic power.

  abstract = {Understanding the structuring elements of soil food webs is a major challenge for ecologists. Given the complex nature of soil food webs, common treatment-based experiments and bivariate data analyses can only capture part of that complexity. Structural equation model (SEM) is a promising multivariate technique that may help understand direct and indirect relationships in complex soil food webs. As bacterial and fungal energy channels, as well as bottom–up and top–down forces operate simultaneously, we used SEM to explore the complex interactions among multiple trophic levels in soil food webs. Further, SEM allowed us to test established theory and to refine and derive hypotheses regarding the structuring forces of soil food webs. We studied detritus-based soil food webs in a 55-year-old subtropical Illicium verum forest ecosystem by sampling different important soil food web components, including main soil microbial groups, soil nematodes, and soil microarthropods. The SEM results confirmed established theory by showing the central role of the fungal energy channel, and bottom–up effects were more important for the structure of the food web than top–down forces in the studied subtropical forest soil. In addition, we could derive some novel and refined hypotheses regarding important feeding links in soil food webs. For instance, we provide hypotheses on feeding preferences of different groups of soil biota and on the strength of bottom–up versus top–down effects in forest soil food webs. Overall, we highlight that SEM provides a framework to understand complex interactions and energy pathways in soil food webs in a multivariate context, test established theory, and propose novel experimental tests.},

Ecological data from 39 Danish sites, each with several wet heathland plots, were sampled in the period 2007–2014. Including resampling over the years, 1322 plots were sampled. Plant cover was measured using the pin-point method and the joint distribution of the key plant species in the wet heathland ecosystem, Erica tetralix, Calluna vulgaris, Molinia caerulea, and an aggregate class of other higher plants was estimated assuming a Dirichlet-multinomial mixture distribution.

The evolutionary relationships of the kingdom have represented some of the more recalcitrant problems in systematics and phylogenetics. The advent of molecular phylogenetics, and more recently phylogenomics, has greatly advanced our understanding of the patterns and processes associated with fungal evolution, however. In this article, we review the major phyla, subphyla, and classes of the kingdom Fungi and provide brief summaries of ecologies, morphologies, and exemplar taxa. We also provide examples of how molecular phylogenetics and evolutionary genomics have advanced our understanding of fungal evolution within each of the phyla and some of the major classes. In the current classification we recognize 8 phyla, 12 subphyla, and 46 classes within the kingdom. The ancestor of fungi is inferred to be zoosporic, and zoosporic fungi comprise three lineages that are paraphyletic to the remainder of fungi. Fungi historically classified as zygomycetes do not form a monophyletic group and are paraphyletic to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are each monophyletic and collectively form the subkingdom Dikarya.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, symbiotic mutualists of many dominant tree and shrub species, exhibit a biogeographic pattern counter to the established latitudinal diversity gradient of most macroflora and fauna. However, an evolutionary basis for this pattern has not been explicitly tested in a diverse lineage. In this study, we reconstructed a mega-phylogeny of a cosmopolitan and hyperdiverse genus of ECM fungi, Russula, sampling from annotated collections and utilizing publically available sequences deposited in GenBank. Metadata from molecular operational taxonomic unit cluster sets were examined to infer the distribution and plant association of the genus. This allowed us to test for differences in patterns of diversification between tropical and extratropical taxa, as well as how their associations with different plant lineages may be a driver of diversification. Results show that Russula is most species-rich at temperate latitudes and ancestral state reconstruction shows that the genus initially diversified in temperate areas. Migration into and out of the tropics characterizes the early evolution of the genus, and these transitions have been frequent since this time. We propose the ‘generalized diversification rate’ hypothesis to explain the reversed latitudinal diversity gradient pattern in Russula as we detect a higher net diversification rate in extratropical lineages. Patterns of diversification with plant associates support host switching and host expansion as driving diversification, with a higher diversification rate in lineages associated with Pinaceae and frequent transitions to association with angiosperms.},

  title = {An Overview of the Phylogeny and Diversity of Eukaryotes},
  abstract = {Our understanding of eukaryote biology is dominated by the study of land plants, animals and fungi. However, these are only three isolated fragments of the full diversity of extant eukaryotes. The majority of eukaryotes, in terms of major taxa and probably also sheer numbers of cells, consists of exclusively or predominantly unicellular lineages. A surprising number of these lineages are poorly characterized. Nonetheless, they are fundamental to our understanding of eukaryote biology and the underlying forces that shaped it. This article consists of an overview of the current state of our understanding of the eukaryote tree. This includes the identity of the major groups of eukaryotes, some of their important, defining or simply interesting features and the proposed relationships of these groups to each other.},

During the last few years, numerous lactarioid specimens have been sampled in various ecosystems from Togo (West Africa). We generated 48 ITS sequences and aligned them against lactarioid taxa from other tropical African ecozones (Guineo-Congolean evergreen forests, Zambezian miombo). A Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree was inferred from a dataset of 109 sequences. The phylogenetic placement of the specimens, combined with morpho-anatomical data, supported the description of four new species from Togo within the monophyletic genus Lactifluus: within subgen. Lactifluus (L. flavellus), subgen. Russulopsis (L. longibasidius and L. pectinatus), and subgen. Edules (L. melleus). This demonstrates that the current species richness of the genus is considerably higher than hitherto estimated for African species and, in addition, a need to redefine the subgenera and sections within it.},

Although there are many methods which provide confidence scores for assigning taxonomic affiliations, it is not straightforward to translate these values to unbiased probabilities. We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical classification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree structure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes the probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for species that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference sequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled reference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression model, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs of other classifiers as predictors.},

Here we reflect on this perspective and contest that the view of GC conflicts with some basic and indisputable principles underpinning the philosophy of science, most notably: it must be free. They appear to believe that taxonomic revisions should be based on political, economic and conservation concerns, and they treat species as fixed real entities, instead of refutable scientific hypotheses. In addition to such theoretical misconceptions, GC did not consider important practical aspects of what they term taxonomic anarchy, most significantly the participation of conservationists as authors of taxonomic works, and the importance of alternative management units, a well-established discussion in conservation biology.},

  abstract = {A novel formulation of the important DNA sequence base-calling problem as well as algorithms for its solution are introduced. The proposed approach is to bring DNA base-calling within the framework of a powerful statistical learning paradigm, which allows the incorporation of prior knowledge about the structure of the problem directly into the base-calling algorithms, without resorting to heuristics. Use of prior knowledge provides constraints which help disambiguate the di erent possible interpretations that the data may have at regions of low SNR, and is shown to lead to a substantial increase of the number of DNA bases that can be accurately called in such regions. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithms, without being optimized, can achieve base-calling performance that matches, and often exceeds, that of commercially available software. Furthermore, due to their statistical basis, they also provide conÿdence estimates (in the form of posterior probabilities) for the produced base call decisions, which can be used for sequence assembly and mutation detection purposes. ? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  shorttitle = {A Universal Algorithm for de Novo Decrypting of Heterozygous Indel Sequences},
  abstract = {Introduction: Indels (insertions/deletions) are important DNA sequence variations because of the high frequency in the human genome, the deleterious effects on the reading frame and protein expression, and the association with disease and disease susceptibility of common diseases. In a recent study with a human individual with the whole genome sequenced, 292,102 heterozygous indels and 559,473 homozygous indels were identified. Decrypting such a large number of heterozygous indels is computationally intensive and requires efficient algorithms. However, the current algorithms for decrypting heterozygous indel cannot be applied to unprecedented sequenced genomes and cannot be performed without reference sequences or reference sequence tracings for sequenced genomes.
Methods: A new algorithm for de novo decrypting of heterozygous indels is conceptualized in the direction of isolating the indel sequence from the genotype or diploid sequence. A universal algorithm is described, here, for heterozygous indel detection, indel size determination, and de novo decrypting of the indel sequence without subtracting the diploid DNA sequence from the reference sequence or reference sequence tracing.
Results: The result obtained by this algorithm is exactly the same as that obtained by PolyPhred and PolyScan. Unlike these algorithms, this new algorithm is not computationally intense for large indels, is independent of sequencing technologies and applies to genotype data derived from all existing sequencing technology platforms. A read of only 29 bases is enough to reduce the false detection rate (FDR) to 1 in a million.
Conclusions: This algorithm is unique amongst all the existing algorithms in terms of performing the task of indel detection, size determination, and decrypting simultaneously. This universal approach eliminates the requirement of a reference sequence or sequence tracing and makes this algorithm unique in decrypting unprecedented sequenced genomes. Because of the high frequency of heterozygous indels in human genome, this universal algorithm will greatly reduce the time required for post-sequencing data analysis in whole genome sequencing of an individual for the practice of personalized medicine.},

Existing computational methods for deconvolution of such traces require knowledge of a reference sequence or the availability of both direct and reverse mixed sequences of the same template. We describe a simple yet accurate method, which uses dynamic programming optimization to predict superimposed allelic sequences solely from a string of letters representing peaks within an individual mixed trace. We used the method to decode 104 human traces (mean length 294 bp) containing heterozygous indels 5 to 30 bp with a mean of 99.1\% bases per allelic sequence reconstructed correctly and unambiguously. Simulations with artificial sequences have demonstrated that the method yields accurate reconstructions when (1) the allelic sequences forming the mixed trace are sufficiently similar, (2) the analyzed fragment is significantly longer than the indel, and (3) multiple indels, if present, are well-spaced. Because these conditions occur in most encountered DNA sequences, the method is widely applicable.

If the sequence trace is of high enough quality, however, it will contain enough information to reconstruct the two constituent sequences with very little ambiguity. Solutions already exist using comparisons with a known reference sequence, but this is often unavailable for nonmodel organisms or novel DNA regions. I present a program which determines the sizes and positions of heterozygous indels in a DNA sequence and reconstructs the two constituent haploid sequences. No external data such as a reference sequence or other prior knowledge are required. Simulation suggests an accuracy of {$>$}99\% from a single read, with errors being eliminable by the inclusion of a second sequencing read, such as one using a reverse primer. Diploid sequences can be fully reconstructed across any number of heterozygous indels, with two overlapping sequencing reads almost always sufficient to infer the entire DNA sequence. This eliminates the need for costly and laborious cloning, and allows data to be used which would otherwise be discarded. With no more laboratory work than is needed to produce two normal sequencing reads, two aligned haploid sequences can be produced quickly and accurately and with extensive phasing information.},

Five genets of A. ostoyae and one of NABS X were identified through the use of somatic incompatibility pairings among the putatively diploid isolates. Armillaria ostoyae genet sizes were approximately 20, 95, 195, 260, and 965 ha; cumulative colonization of the study area was at least 9.5\%. The maximum distance between isolates from the 965-ha A. ostoyae genet was approximately 3810 m, and use of three estimates of A. ostoyae spread rate in conifer forests resulted in age estimates for the genet ranging from 1900 to 8650 years. Results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms that influenced the establishment, expansion, and expression of these genets; the genetic structure and stability of Armillaria; and the implications for disease management in this and similar forests.},

  abstract = {Porcini (Boletus section Boletus: Boletaceae: Boletineae: Boletales) are a conspicuous group of wild, edible mushrooms characterized by fleshy fruiting bodies with a poroid hymenophore that is ‘‘stuffed’’ with white hyphae when young. Their reported distribution is with ectomycorrhizal plants throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Little progress has been made on the systematics of this group using modern molecular phylogenetic tools because sampling has been limited primarily to European species and the genes employed were insufficient to resolve the phylogeny. We examined the evolutionary history of porcini by using a global geographic sampling of most known species, new discoveries from little explored areas, and multiple genes. We used 78 sequences from the fast-evolving nuclear internal transcribed spacers and are able to recognize 18 reciprocally monophyletic species. To address whether or not porcini form a monophyletic group, we compiled a broadly sampled dataset of 41 taxa, including other members of the Boletineae, and used separate and combined phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and the mitochondrial ATPase subunit six gene. Contrary to previous studies, our separate and combined phylogenetic analyses support the monophyly of porcini. We also report the discovery of two taxa that expand the known distribution of porcini to Australia and Thailand and have ancient phylogenetic connections to the rest of the group. A relaxed molecular clock analysis with these new taxa dates the origin of porcini to between 42 and 54 million years ago, coinciding with the initial diversification of angiosperms, during the Eocene epoch when the climate was warm and humid. These results reveal an unexpected diversity, distribution, and ancient origin of a group of commercially valuable mushrooms that may provide an economic incentive for conservation and support the hypothesis of a tropical origin of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.},

Experiments were undertaken to predict the distribution of real and simulated species using MaxEnt and presence-only data “contaminated” with varying rates of misidentification error. Additionally, the difference between the niche of the target and contaminating species was varied. The results show that species misidentification errors may act to contract or expand the predicted distribution of a species while shifting the predicted distribution towards that of the contaminating species. Furthermore the magnitude of the effects was positively related to the ecological distance between the species’ niches and the size of the error rates. Critically, the magnitude of the effects was substantial even when using small error rates, smaller than common average rates reported in the literature, which may go unnoticed while using a standard evaluation method, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, the effects outlined were shown to impact negatively on practical applications that use SDMs to identify priority areas, commonly selected for various purposes such as management. The results highlight that species misidentification should not be neglected in species distribution modeling.},

The species-area relationship of macrofungi in tropical and temperate climatic zones and four different land use systems were investigated by determining the macrofungal species richness in plot sizes ranging from 100~m2 to 10~000~m2 over two sampling seasons. We found that the effect of plot size on recorded species richness significantly differed between land use systems with the exception of monoculture systems. For both climate zones, land use system needs to be considered when determining optimal plot size. Using an optimal plot size was more important than temporal replication (over two sampling seasons) in accurately recording species richness.},

  abstract = {Herbarium specimens are a treasure trove for biochemical studies. However, this implies understanding of the chemical changes during the drying and storage of the specimen. We compared herbarium specimens at different ages and fresh samples of four mushroom species (Kuehneromyces mutabilis, Hypholoma capnoides, Kuehneromyces lignicola, Hypholoma fasciculare) of two genera in the family Strophariaceae by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA). 25 metabolites were identified. No significant alterations were found between herbarium samples at different ages, suggesting that they are stable enough for comparative studies. The most dominant differences between fresh and herbarium samples was that sugars such as α-α-trehalose, and fumaric and malic acids were more abundant in fresh fungi. Total contents of fatty and amino acids, uracil and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were higher in herbarium specimens. In addition, pyroglutamic acid was observed only in Kuehneromyces mutabilis and fasciculic acid E in Hypholoma fasciculare. Hence, based on results of the studied taxa, we conclude that NMR metabolomics can be used for both fresh and dried mushrooms when such alterations are properly addressed.},

  abstract = {Mushroom-forming fungi (restricted to basidiomycetous fungi in this review) differentiate by sensing several environmental factors for fruiting body formation. For fruiting body induction, nutrient, temperature and light conditions are critical environmental factors. Higher nitrogen and carbon sources in the media will suppress fruiting body induction in many mushroom-forming fungi, with induction being triggered by lower nitrogen and carbon concentrations. Low temperature or temperature downshift is another critical influencing factor for fruiting body induction in many cultivated mushrooms, such as Flammulina velutipes, Lentinula edodes, and Volvariella volvacea. Fungal response toward starvation and cold involves the production of sexual spores as the next generation. Species like F. velutipes and Coprinopsis cinerea can form fruiting bodies in the dark; however, light accelerates fruiting body induction in some mushroom-forming fungi. Remarkably, fruiting bodies formed in the dark have tiny or no pileus on heads (called dark stipe, pinhead fruiting body, or etiolated stipe). Light is essential for pileus differentiation in many, but not all mushroom species; one exception is Agaricus bisporus. Mushrooms have positive phototropism and negative gravitropism for effective dispersal of spores. Carbon dioxide concentrations also affect fruiting body development; pileus differentiation is suppressed at a high concentration of carbon dioxide. Thus, the pileus differentiation system of mushrooms may allow the most effective diffusion of spores. Full expansion of the pileus is followed by pileus autolysis or senescence. In C. cinerea, pileus autolysis occurs during spore diffusion. Fruiting body senescence, browning of gill, and softening occur after harvesting in several mushroom species. Fruiting body induction, development, and maturation in mushroom-forming fungi are discussed in this review.},

  abstract = {Recent scientific and technological advances have improved and streamlined our ability to recognise and describe fungal species. Detailed comparative genomics studies have also expanded our understanding of species boundaries. Against this background, we explore the nature of fungal species and consider how this impacts our understanding of their genetics and evolution. The current body of evidence suggests that fungal species are unique evolutionary units that are separated from one another by boundaries that are “porous” under certain conditions (“semipermeable” in analogy to the differential permeability of membranes). Overall, the penetrability of these boundaries depends on the relatedness between donor and recipient species, the spatial proximity of related species to one another during their evolution, and the evolutionary potential associated with the breach of a boundary. Furthermore, the semipermeable nature of species boundaries fundamentally affects the population genetics of a species, with potentially profound effects on its overall evolution and biology. This also influences the methodologies used in taxonomy, because some species appear capable of maintaining their genetic isolation despite extensive penetrability of their boundaries. Most analytical procedures are also not able to distinguish the signals of species boundary permeability from those associated with incomplete lineage sorting or intraspecific diversity. Collectively, these issues greatly complicate how we study and name fungi. An awareness of the nature of species, their boundaries and the biological and genomic signatures of boundary breaches, will enhance our ability to identify them and, perhaps more importantly, to develop realistic strategies to manage and manipulate their growth and distribution.},

  abstract = {Fungi are more important to our lives than is assumed by the general public. They can comprise both devastating pathogens and plant-associated mutualists in nature, and several species have also become important workhorses of biotechnology. Fungal diversity research has in a short time transcended from a low-tech research area to a method-intensive high-tech discipline. With the advent of the new genomic and post-genomic methodologies, large quantities of new fungal data are currently becoming available each year. Whilst these new data and methodologies may help modern fungal diversity researchers to explore and discover the yet hidden diversity within a context of biological processes and organismal diversity, they need to be reconciled with the traditional approaches. Such a synthesis is actually difficult to accomplish given the current discouraging situation of fungal biology education, especially in the areas of biodiversity and taxonomic research. The number of fungal diversity researchers and taxonomists in academic institutions is decreasing, as are opportunities for mycological education in international curricula. How can we educate and stimulate students to pursue a career in fungal diversity research and taxonomy and avoid the situation whereby only those few institutions with strong financial support are able to conduct excellent research? Our short answer is that we need a combination of increased specialization and increased collaboration, i.e. that scientists with specialized expertise (e.g., in data generation, compilation, interpretation, and communication) consistently work together to generate and deliver new fungal knowledge in a more integrative manner – closing the gap between both traditional and modern approaches and academic and non-academic environments. Here we discuss how this perspective could be implemented in the training of the ‘next generation fungal diversity researcher’.},

These negative impacts include changes to the biodiversity and function of soil fungal communities, which contribute towards nutrient cycling and interact with other organisms in belowground ecosystems, and may be pathogens. Despite the important role of soil fungi in rubber plantations, these communities have been poorly studied. In this paper, we review the existing literature on the diversity and ecology of belowground fungi in rubber plantations. Various groups of soil fungi, including saprobes, symbionts, and pathogens are discussed. Additionally, the role of plantation management is discussed in the context of both pathogenic soil fungi and the promotion of beneficial soil fungi. Management practices include clone selection, tree age and planting density, application of chemicals, and intercropping systems. Our review shows the strong need for further research into the effects of monoculture rubber plantations on soil fungal communities, and how we can best manage these systems in the future, in order to create a more sustainable approach to rubber production.},

  abstract = {Allorecognition in fungi takes the form of vegetative incompatibility (VI), a process leading to the programmed cell death of heterokaryotic cells formed after anastomosis between hyphae of genetically incompatible isolates, thereby keeping different genotypes separated. VI is ubiquitous amongst ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, determined by loci named het or vic, and responds to both promoting and limiting selective constraints. While VI has been widely used to analyze fungal populations, genes controlling VI systems have only been characterized at the molecular level in three ascomycete species. VI systems can be considered as having a modular organization, comprised of a polymorphic component for recognition associated with a cell death inducing component often (but not exclusively) including a HET domain protein. However, the actual genes involved differ in sequence and properties. Some VI genes display a patchy phylogenetic distribution, whereas others appear widely conserved in fungal genomes, but their function in controlling VI is restricted to a single or a few related species. It also appears that evolutionary trajectories generating and maintaining polymorphism at these loci differ. Some het genes show low allelic diversity and signs of long term balancing selection and may be specifically selected for allorecognition. Others show high allelic diversity, evidence of positive selection and fast evolution and their products are believed to correspond to immune receptors whose functions have been coopted for allorecognition. Finally, where known, mechanisms for initiating cell death and the cell death reaction itself display similarities and differences between different model species. All these data support the hypothesis that VI is a ubiquitous phenomenon acquired time and time again independently in different fungal lineages.},

The method is illustrated using ecological data on the abundances of species in sites and where the species are characterized by traits and sites by environmental variables. The trait data and environment data form the external constraints and the question is which traits and environmental variables are associated, how these associations drive species abundances and how they can be displayed in biplots.

  abstract = {Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) forests play an important ecological and economic role. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMF) are key components for the sustainability and functioning of these ecosystems. The community structure and composition of ECMF associated with Q. suber in different landscapes of distinct Mediterranean bioclimate regions have not previously been compared. In this work, soil samples from cork oak forests residing in different bioclimates (arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid) were collected and surveyed for ectomycorrhizal (ECM) root tips. A global analysis performed on 3565 ECM root tips revealed that the ECMF community is highly enriched in Russula, Tomentella, and Cenoccocum, which correspond to the ECMF genera that mainly contribute to community differences. The ECMF communities from the rainiest and the driest cork oak forests were distinct, with soils from the rainiest climates being more heterogeneous than those from the driest climates. The analyses of several abiotic factors on the ECMF communities revealed that bioclimate, precipitation, soil texture, and forest management strongly influenced ECMF structure. Shifts in ECMF with different hyphal exploration types were also detected among forests, with precipitation, forest system, and soil texture being the main drivers controlling their composition. Understanding the effects of environmental factors on the structuring of ECM communities could be the first step for promoting the sustainability of this threatened ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Understanding how soil pedogenesis affects microbial communities and their in situ activities according to ecosystem functioning is a central issue in soil microbial ecology, as soils represent essential nutrient reservoirs and habitats for the biosphere. To address this question, soil chronosequences developed from a single, shared mineralogical parent material and having the same climate conditions are particularly useful, as they isolate the factor of time from other factors controlling the character of soils. In our study, we considered a natural succession of uplifted marine terraces in Mendocino, CA, ranging from highly fertile in the younger terrace (about 100,000 years old) to infertile in the older terraces (about 300,000 years old). Using ITS amplicon pyrosequencing, we analysed and compared the diversity and composition of the soil fungal communities across the first terraces (T1 to T3), with a specific focus in the forested terraces (T2 and T3) on soil samples collected below trees of the same species (Pinus muricata) and of the same age. While diversity and richness indices were highest in the grassland (youngest) terrace (T1), they were higher in the older forested terrace (T3) compared to the younger forested terrace (T2). Interestingly, the most abundant ectomycorrhizal (ECM) taxa that we found within these fungal communities showed high homology with ITS Sanger sequences obtained previously directly from ECM root tips from trees in the same study site, revealing a relative conservation of ECM diversity over time. Altogether, our results provide new information about the diversity and composition of the fungal communities as well as on the dominant ECM species in the soil chronosequence of Mendocino in relation to soil age and ecosystem development.},

  abstract = {Despite covering vast areas of boreal North America, the ecological factors structuring mycorrhizal fungal communities in peatland forests are relatively poorly understood. To assess how these communities vary by age (younger vs. mature), habitat (fen vs. bog), and host (conifer trees vs. ericaceous shrub), we sampled the roots of two canopy trees (Larix laricina and Picea mariana) and an ericaceous shrub (Ledum groenlandicum) at four sites in northern Minnesota, USA. To characterize the specific influence of host co-occurrence on mycorrhizal fungal community structure, we also conducted a greenhouse bioassay using the same three hosts. Root samples were assessed using Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the ITS1 rRNA gene region. As expected, we found that the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi was high on both Larix and Picea, whereas ericoid mycorrhizal fungi had high relative abundance only on Ledum. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungal richness was significantly higher in mature forests, in bogs, and on Ledum hosts, while ectomycorrhizal fungal richness did not differ significantly across any of these three variables. In terms of community composition, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi were more strongly influenced by host while ectomycorrhizal fungi were more influenced by habitat. In the greenhouse bioassay, the presence of Ledum had consistently stronger effects on the composition of ectomycorrhizal, ericoid, and ericoid-ectomycorrhizal fungal communities than either Larix or Picea. Collectively, these results suggest that partitioning HTS-based datasets by mycorrhizal type in boreal peatland forests is important, as their responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions are not likely to be uniform.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, as symbionts of many tree species in temperate forests, are thought to play an important role in forest regeneration processes after large disturbances. Their reaction to different disturbance and management regimes was studied in spruce forests (Lariceto-Piceetum) 10 years after a severe windthrow in the Tatra National Park (Slovak Republic). ECM community structure was compared between different “management types″—cleared area (EXT), area affected by wildfire (FIRE), uncleared area left for natural development (NEX), and mature forest as a control (REF). Based on Illumina sequencing of soil samples, we determined that the percentage of sequences assigned to ECM fungi decreased with increasing disturbance and management intensity (REF → NEX → EXT → FIRE). Similarly, the total number of ECM species per each of ten sampling points per plot (100 ha) differed between managed (EXT-11 species, FIRE-9) and unmanaged (NEX-16, REF-14) treatments. On the other hand, the percentage of sequences belonging to ericoid mycorrhizal fungi increased. Management type significantly influenced the composition of the ECM community, while vegetation and soil characteristics explained less data variation. The ECM species assemblage of the unmanaged site (NEX) was the most similar to the mature forest, while that of the burnt site was the most different. Thelephora terrestris dominated in all treatments affected by windthrow, accompanied by Tylospora fibrillosa (NEX) and Tylospora asterophora (EXT and FIRE). Management regime was also the most important factor affecting ECM species composition on the roots of spruce seedlings assessed by Sanger sequencing.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration causes the second largest C flux between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Emerging soil carbon dynamics models consider the complex interplay of microscale interactions between the physical and biological drivers of soil organic matter decomposition occurring in the 3D soil architecture. They are expected to provide a way to upscale results to the macroscopic level and as such appear as an alternative modelling approach to the traditional “black-box” macroscopic models. However, these models still need to be tested under a broader range of their parameters values and structures than has been the case to date. We thus conducted uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of previous predictions on dissolved organic carbon biodegradation obtained by one of these microscopic carbon dynamics models, LBioS. Six parameters of the carbon dynamics module of LBioS, associated with bacterial metabolism and three microscopic 3D descriptors of soil architecture were considered as uncertain inputs. We built two complete factorial designs in which the minimum and maximum of uncertainty intervals are considered. Each factorial design is assigned to a particular structure of the model, one including dormancy of bacteria and the other considering optimal bacterial activity. The scenarios took place in 3D computed tomography images of an undisturbed cultivated soil. The sensitivity indices at different simulations dates were computed with an ANOVA procedure taking into account main effects and interactions among factors. The uncertainty analysis shows that only in the limiting case of low accessibility of resources to bacteria the different microbial metabolisms tested can modify to a small extent the system responses, and uncertainty linked to parameters describing soil architecture becomes preponderant. In the case of optimal accessibility output variability is due predominantly to uncertainty of the microbial metabolism parameters. The sensitivity analysis suggests that whatever the structure of the model, the role of soil architecture in the microbial activity can be evidenced using either DOC or CO2 as proxy measures. Beyond these results, we stress that results of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of soil carbon models need to be interpreted with caution, dependent as they are on the status of the model itself, as well as on the particular scenarios used in the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.},

  abstract = {Conventional ecology lacks a non-contingent theory on the relationship between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors under natural or quasi-natural conditions. As a result, since ecology is the science that studies the interaction between ecological factors in nested complex systems, we should recognize that ecology needs significant enhancements to understand the functioning of ecosystems. This article combines the ecological state equation (ESE, one of the earliest models derived from the Organic Biophysics of Ecosystem –OBEC), with abundant field data of abiotic factors, biotic factors and human factors from inland water rotifers and crustaceans (1022 samples taken over 21 years), litter invertebrates in laurel forest and pine forest (308 samples), and marine interstitial meiofauna of sandy beaches (90 samples). This has been done in order to obtain additional empirical evidence on the intrinsic trend to stationarity in the long run, even in perturbed ecosystems (man-made eutrophic water reservoirs, forest vegetation affected by traffic, and coastal ecosystems close to disposal points of sewage that are fully or partially treated, respectively to the above-mentioned taxocenes), and the relationship between the above-mentioned ecological factors. Our results indicate that there is a complex natural arrangement that intertwines the trend to stationarity and the resilience capability of ecosystems with a clear pattern of hierarchical setup between ecological factors. This is reflected by the role of ESE as a trophodynamic interface in hierarchical statistical models (cluster analysis) because they involve, in the following order of increasing rank: lower level abiotic factors (a.f.), biotic factors (b.f.), the holistic combination of state variables included in the ESE and, finally, higher level human factors (h.f.). In such a way, there is a clear trend to a hierarchical assemblage in agreement with the evolutionary origin of ecological factors in the deep time, as well as in regard to the net direction (⟵) of ecological homeostasis: a.f. ⟵ b.f. ⟵ h.f. In this setup, the ESE accomplishes a key liaison role, because it reflects a long run trend to stationarity which allows an essential degree of ecological stability, as well as our capability to classify ecosystems, in spite of the random influence of ecological perturbations in the short run. The above-mentioned set of additional evidence can be regarded as a step to develop a non-contingent theory about the relationship between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors. Furthermore, since the OBEC, in its origin, deals with only the dynamics of biotic variables, this is the first time that the interaction between one of its main models and other kind of ecological factors is studied yielding reliable results in the process.},

  abstract = {Ecological studies may produce presence-absence data sets for different taxonomic groups, with varying spatial resolution and temporal coverage. Comparisons of these data are needed to extract meaningful information on the background ecological factors explaining community patterns, to improve our understanding of how beta diversity and its components vary among communities and biogeographical regions, and to reveal their possible implications for biodiversity conservation. A methodological difficulty is that the number of sampling units may be unequal: no method has been designed as yet to compare data matrices in such cases. The problem is solved by converting presence-absence data matrices to simplex plots based on the decomposition of Jaccard dissimilarity into species replacement and richness difference fractions used together with the complementary similarity function. Pairs of simplex plots representing different data matrices are then compared by quantifying, for each of them, the relative frequency of points in small, pre-defined subregions of the simplex, and then calculating a divergence function between the two frequency distributions. Given more than two data matrices, classification and ordination techniques may be used to obtain a synthetic and informative picture of metacommunity structure. We demonstrate the potential of our data analytical model by applying it to different case studies spanning different spatial scales and taxonomic levels (Mediterranean Island faunas; Finnish stream macroinvertebrate assemblages; Hungarian forest assemblages), and to a study of temporal changes in small islands (insect fauna in Florida). We conclude that, by accounting for various structural aspects simultaneously, the method permits a thorough ecological interpretation of presence-absence data. Furthermore, the examples illustrate succinctly how similarity, beta diversity and two of its additive components, species replacement and richness difference influence presence-absence patterns under different conditions.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are complex adaptive systems that exhibit remarkable feedbacks between their biomass and trait dynamics. Trait-based aggregate models cope with this complexity by focusing on the temporal development of the community’s aggregate properties such as its total biomass, mean trait and trait variance. They are based on particular assumptions about the shape of the underlying trait distribution, which is commonly assumed to be normal. However, ecologically important traits are usually restricted to a finite range, and empirical trait distributions are often skewed or multimodal. As a result, normal distribution-based aggregate models may fail to adequately represent the biomass and trait dynamics of natural communities. We resolve this mismatch by developing a new moment closure approach assuming the trait values to be beta-distributed. We show that the beta distribution captures important shape properties of both observed and simulated trait distributions, which cannot be captured by a Gaussian. We further demonstrate that a beta distribution-based moment closure can strongly enhance the reliability of trait-based aggregate models. We compare the biomass, mean trait and variance dynamics of a full trait distribution (FD) model to the ones of beta (BA) and normal (NA) distribution-based aggregate models, under different selection regimes. This way, we demonstrate under which general conditions (stabilizing, fluctuating or disruptive selection) different aggregate models are reliable tools. All three models predicted very similar biomass and trait dynamics under stabilizing selection yielding unimodal trait distributions with small standing trait variation. We also obtained an almost perfect match between the results of the FD and BA models under fluctuating selection, promoting skewed trait distributions and ongoing oscillations in the biomass and trait dynamics. In contrast, the NA model showed unrealistic trait dynamics and exhibited different alternative stable states, and thus a high sensitivity to initial conditions under fluctuating selection. Under disruptive selection, both aggregate models failed to reproduce the results of the FD model with the mean trait values remaining within their ecologically feasible ranges in the BA model but not in the NA model. Overall, a beta distribution-based moment closure strongly improved the realism of trait-based aggregate models.},

Although it is implicitly assumed that the microbial DNA recovered from soil predominantly represents intact cells, it is unclear how extracellular DNA affects molecular analyses of microbial diversity. We examined a wide range of soils using viability PCR based on the photoreactive DNA-intercalating dye propidium monoazide4. We found that, on average, 40\% of both prokaryotic and fungal DNA was extracellular or from cells that were no longer intact. Extracellular DNA inflated the observed prokaryotic and fungal richness by up to 55\% and caused significant misestimation of taxon relative abundances, including the relative abundances of taxa integral to key ecosystem processes. Extracellular DNA was not found in measurable amounts in all soils; it was more likely to be present in soils with low exchangeable base cation concentrations, and the effect of its removal on microbial community structure was more profound in high-pH soils. Together, these findings imply that this ‘relic DNA’ remaining in soil after cell death can obscure treatment effects, spatiotemporal patterns and relationships between microbial taxa and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of spatiotemporal patterns in species distribution is fundamental to understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping communities. The emergence of DNA-based tools has expanded the geographic and taxonomic scope of studies examining spatial and temporal distribution of mycorrhizal fungi. However, the nature of spatiotemporal patterns documented and subsequent interpretation of ecological processes can vary significantly from study to study. In order to look for general patterns we synthesize the available data across different sampling scales and mycorrhizal types. The results of this analysis shed light on the relative importance of space, time and vertical soil structure on community variability across different mycorrhizal types. Although we found no significant trend in spatiotemporal variation among mycorrhizal types, the vertical community variation was distinctly greater than the spatial and temporal variability in mycorrhizal fungal communities. Both spatial and temporal variability of communities was greater in topsoil compared with lower horizons, suggesting that greater environmental heterogeneity drives community variation on a fine scale. This further emphasizes the importance of both niche differentiation and environmental filtering in maintaining diverse fungal communities.},

Here, we predicted 18S rRNA primers based on consecutive conserved sites and evaluated their coverage efficiency and scope of application to different eukaryotic groups. After evaluation, eight of them were considered as qualified 18S primers based on coverage rate. Next, we examined common conserved regions in prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA sequences to design 16S/18S universal primers. Three 16S/18S candidate primers, U515, U1390 and U1492, were then considered to be suitable for simultaneous amplification of the rRNA sequences in three domains. Eukaryotic 18S and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes in a sponge were amplified simultaneously using universal primers U515 and U1390, and the subsequent sorting of pyrosequenced reads revealed some distinctive communities in different parts of the sample. The real difference in biodiversity between prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts could be discerned as the dissimilarity between OTUs was increased from 0.005 to 0.1. A network of the communities in external and internal parts of the sponge illustrated the co-variation of some unique microbes in certain parts of the sponge, suggesting that the universal primers are useful in simultaneous detection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities.},

  abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via ‘‘SNP chip’’ microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotypephenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has yielded a powerful array of tools to address fundamental biological questions at a scale that was inconceivable just a few years ago. Various genome partitioning strategies to sequence select subsets of the genome have emerged as powerful alternatives to whole genome sequencing in ecological and evolutionary genomic studies. High throughput targeted capture is one such strategy that involves the parallel enrichment of pre-selected genomic regions of interest. The growing use of targeted capture demonstrates its potential power to address a range of research questions, yet these approaches have yet to expand broadly across labs focused on evolutionary and ecological genomics. In part, the use of targeted capture has been hindered by the logistics of capture design and implementation in species without established reference genomes. Here we aim to 1) increase the accessibility of targeted capture to researchers working in non-model taxa by discussing capture methods that circumvent the need of a reference genome, 2) highlight the evolutionary and ecological applications where this approach is emerging as a powerful sequencing strategy, and 3) discuss the future of targeted capture and other genome partitioning approaches in light of the increasing accessibility of whole genome sequencing. Given the practical advantages and increasing feasibility of high-throughput targeted capture, we anticipate an ongoing expansion of capture-based approaches in evolutionary and ecological research, synergistic with an expansion of whole genome sequencing.},

  abstract = {Conventional marker-based genotyping platforms are widely available, but not without their limitations. In this context, we developed Sequence-Based Genotyping (SBG), a technology for simultaneous marker discovery and co-dominant scoring, using next-generation sequencing. SBG offers users several advantages including a generic sample preparation method, a highly robust genome complexity reduction strategy to facilitate de novo marker discovery across entire genomes, and a uniform bioinformatics workflow strategy to achieve genotyping goals tailored to individual species, regardless of the availability of a reference sequence. The most distinguishing features of this technology are the ability to genotype any population structure, regardless whether parental data is included, and the ability to co-dominantly score SNP markers segregating in populations. To demonstrate the capabilities of SBG, we performed marker discovery and genotyping in Arabidopsis thaliana and lettuce, two plant species of diverse genetic complexity and backgrounds. Initially we obtained 1,409 SNPs for arabidopsis, and 5,583 SNPs for lettuce. Further filtering of the SNP dataset produced over 1,000 high quality SNP markers for each species. We obtained a genotyping rate of 201.2 genotypes/SNP and 58.3 genotypes/SNP for arabidopsis (n = 222 samples) and lettuce (n = 87 samples), respectively. Linkage mapping using these SNPs resulted in stable map configurations. We have therefore shown that the SBG approach presented provides users with the utmost flexibility in garnering high quality markers that can be directly used for genotyping and downstream applications. Until advances and costs will allow for routine whole-genome sequencing of populations, we expect that sequence-based genotyping technologies such as SBG will be essential for genotyping of model and non-model genomes alike.},

  abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-bysequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

  abstract = {Background: 2b-RAD (type IIB endonucleases restriction-site associated DNA) approach was invented by Wang in 2012 and proven as a simple and flexible method for genome-wide genotyping. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement for the existent 2b-RAD approach. Firstly, it doesn’t include the samples pooling in library preparation as other reduced representation libraries. Secondly, the information of 2b-RAD tags, such as tags numbers and distributions, in most of species are unknown. The purposes of the research are to improve a new 2b-RAD approach which possesses samples pooling, moreover to figure out the characteristic and application potentiality of 2b-RAD tags by bioinformatics analysis.
Results: Twelve adapter1 and an adapter2 were designed. A library approach comprising digestion, ligation, pooling, PCR and size selection were established. For saving costs, we used non-phosphorylated adapters and indexed PCR primers. A F2 population of rice (Oryza sativa .L) was genotyped to validate the new approach. On average, 2000332 high quality reads of each sample were obtained with high evenness. Totally 3598 markers containing 3804 SNPs were discovered and the missing rate was 18.9\%. A genetic linkage map of 1385 markers was constructed and 92\% of the markers’ orders in the genetic map were in accordance with the orders in chromosomes. Meanwhile, the bioinformatics simulation in 20 species showed that the BsaXI had the most widespread recognition sites, indicating that 2b-RAD tags had a powerful application potentiality for high density genetic map. Using modified adapters with a fix base in 3′end, 2b-RAD was also fit for QTL studies with low costs.
Conclusions: An improved 2b-RAD genotyping approach was established in this research and named as I2b-RAD. The method was a simple, fast, cost-effective and multiplex sequencing library approach. It could be adjusted by selecting different enzymes and adapters to fit for alternative uses including chromosomes assembly, QTL fine mapping and even natural population analysis.},

  abstract = {Here, we introduce ezRAD, a novel strategy for restriction site–associated DNA (RAD) that requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment, and demonstrate its utility for ten non-model organisms across a wide taxonomic range. ezRAD differs from other RAD methods primarily through its use of standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation kits, which makes it possible for any laboratory to send out to a commercial genomic core facility for library preparation and next-generation sequencing with virtually no additional investment beyond the cost of the service itself. This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range, without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step, which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of nonmodel organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.},

  abstract = {Distributions of species, animals or plants, terrestrial or aquatic, are influenced by numerous factors such as physical and biogeographical gradients. Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial filtering technique that offers as much flexibility as the Moran’s eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. Information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process influencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Que´ bec.},

  abstract = {Background: Lethal amanitas (Amanita section Phalloideae) are a group of wild, fatal mushrooms causing many poisoning cases worldwide. However, the diversity and evolutionary history of these lethal mushrooms remain poorly known due to the limited sampling and insufficient gene fragments employed for phylogenetic analyses. In this study, five gene loci (nrLSU, ITS, rpb2, ef1-α and β-tubulin) with a widely geographic sampling from East and South Asia, Europe, North and Central America, South Africa and Australia were analysed with maximum-likelihood, maximum-parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Biochemical analyses were also conducted with intention to detect amatoxins and phalloidin in 14 representative samples.
Result: Lethal amanitas were robustly supported to be a monophyletic group after excluding five species that were provisionally defined as lethal amanitas based on morphological studies. In lethal amanitas, 28 phylogenetic species were recognised by integrating molecular phylogenetic analyses with morphological studies, and 14 of them represented putatively new species. The biochemical analyses indicated a single origin of cyclic peptide toxins (amatoxins and phalloidin) within Amanita and suggested that this kind of toxins seemed to be a synapomorphy of lethal amanitas. Molecular dating through BEAST and biogeographic analyses with LAGRANGE and RASP indicated that lethal amanitas most likely originated in the Palaeotropics with the present crown group dated around 64.92 Mya in the early Paleocene, and the East Asia–eastern North America or Eurasia–North America–Central America disjunct distribution patterns were primarily established during the middle Oligocene to Miocene.
Conclusion: The cryptic diversity found in this study indicates that the species diversity of lethal amanitas is strongly underestimated under the current taxonomy. The intercontinental sister species or sister groups relationships among East Asia and eastern North America or Eurasia–North America–Central America within lethal amanitas are best explained by the diversification model of Palaeotropical origin, dispersal via the Bering Land Bridge, followed by regional vicariance speciation resulting from climate change during the middle Oligocene to the present. These findings indicate the importance of both dispersal and vicariance in shaping the intercontinental distributions of these ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

  abstract = {The ectomycorrhizal (EM) canopy tree Dicymbe corymbosa (Fabaceae subfam. Caesalpinioideae) forms monodominant forests in the Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana. Like other tropical monodominants, D. corymbosa has several life-history traits that promote conspecific clumping, in contrast to density-dependent recruitment limitations characterizing most tropical trees. Dicymbe corymbosa forests, occurring in Guyana as patches within a largely non-EM mixed-species forest matrix, are important habitats for a diverse assemblage of EM fungi. Ground-based studies have not adequately determined the regional extent of D. corymbosa forests, nor are they practical due to the rugged, remote nature of the Pakaraima Mountains. We assessed the suitability of Landsat satellite imagery for mapping regional distribution of D. corymbosa forests in Guyana's Upper Potaro River Basin. Supervised image classification was performed on images from August 1989 (Landsat-5 TM) and October 1999 (Landsat-7 ETM+). In situ forest reference data were used to quantitatively assess accuracy of output classification maps. Classification performed well in distinguishing monodominant from mixed-species forests. For both images, D. corymbosa forest class accuracy was good (1989 user's accuracy = 89.8\%, Khat= 0.74; 1999 user's accuracy = 80.7\%, Khat= 0.59). The resulting output classification maps will be useful for planning fungal surveys and ecological studies in forests of the Pakaraima region. Classification of Landsat images may be effective for identifying monodominant forests in other remote regions of the tropics.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models usually attempt to explain presence-absence or abundance of a species at a site in terms of the environmental features (socalled abiotic features) present at the site. Historically, such models have considered species individually. However, it is well-established that species interact to influence presence-absence and abundance (envisioned as biotic factors). As a result, there has been substantial recent interest in joint species distribution models with various types of response, e.g., presence-absence, continuous and ordinal data. Such models incorporate dependence between species response as a surrogate for interaction. The challenge we focus on here is how to address such modeling in the context of a large number of species (e.g., order 102) across sites numbering in the order of 102 or 103 when, in practice, only a few species are found at any observed site. Again, there is some recent literature to address this; we adopt a dimension reduction approach. The novel wrinkle we add here is spatial dependence. That is, we have a collection of sites over a relatively small spatial region so it is anticipated that species distribution at a given site would be similar to that at a nearby site. Specifically, we handle dimension reduction through Dirichlet processes joined with spatial dependence through Gaussian processes. We use both simulated data and a plant communities dataset for the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa to demonstrate our approach. The latter consists of presence-absence measurements for 639 tree species on 662 locations. Through both data examples we are able to demonstrate improved predictive performance using the foregoing specification.},

To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

However, little is known about genomic and microbiome features of most uncultured symbiotic fungal clades. Here, we analysed the genome and microbiome of Inocybaceae (Agaricales, Basidiomycota), a largely uncultured ectomycorrhizal clade known to form symbiotic associations with a wide variety of plant species. We used metagenomic sequencing and assembly of dikaryotic fruiting-body tissues from Inocybe terrigena (Fr.) Kuyper, to classify fungal and bacterial genomic sequences, and obtained a nearly complete fungal genome containing 93\% of core eukaryotic genes. Comparative genomics reveals that I. terrigena is more similar to ectomycorrhizal and brown rot fungi than to white rot fungi. The reduction in lignin degradation capacity has been independent from and significantly faster than in closely related ectomycorrhizal clades supporting that ectomycorrhizal symbiosis evolved independently in Inocybe. The microbiome of I. terrigena fruiting-bodies includes bacteria with known symbiotic functions in other fungal and non-fungal host environments, suggesting potential symbiotic functions of these bacteria in fungal tissues regardless of habitat conditions. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of direct metagenomics analysis of fruiting-body tissues for characterizing fungal genomes and microbiome.},

A decade ago, we had little information about intraspecific somatic mycelial interactions within species and an almost complete lack of information regarding the structure and organization of fungal populations. Since then, however, somatic mycelial interactions have been studied in more than 100 fungal species, and the results applied to studies of population structure in almost 50 species (Rayner 1991; Glass and Kuldau 1992).

Previous workers have used somatic incompatibility testing to distinguish clones or individuals in natural populations of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, somatic incompatibility tests performed with isolates of Suillus granulatus from a natural population revealed a lack of transitiveness, which brought into question the validity of this method. Subsequent studies of genetic identity of these isolates, using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, conclusively showed that somatically compatible isolates are not necessarily genetically identical. RAPD marker analysis is more reliable and provides higher resolution of genotype distribution in natural populations than does somatic incompatibility testing. This is of particular importance in populations of organisms such as ectomycorrhizal fungi in which the mating systems are incompletely known.},

Although, these results have been impressive, they have been tempered by sampling difficulties and limited by the taxonomic resolution of restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Minor modifications of the sampling schemes, and more use of direct sequencing, has the potential to solve these problems.

A lyophilization treatment prior to extraction increased yields from Marshan but not from Zurich and Batavia soils. Losses of ergosterol during lyophilization were prevented by a rapid freezing treatment before lyophilization of soil samples. Recoveries from soil fortified with pure ergosterol did not accutately model recoveries from fungal tissue in these substrates. Thus, determinations of extraction efficiencies should be based upon recoveries from fungal tissue added to soils. Ergosterol was quantitatively recovered from Marshan and Zurich soils fortified with fungal tissue; however, only ca 66\% was recovered from Batavia soil, a subsoil with a high clay content. The limit of detection of Phanerochaete chrysosporium from the three soils ranged from 8 to 15 μg biomass g soil−1.},

An objective of our study was to quantify ergosterol in a range of ectomycorrhizal isolates under differing growth conditions. In addition, we tested the applicability of the method on field-collected roots of ectomycorrhizal and vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal plants. Quantification of sitosterol as a biomass indicator of plant roots was also undertaken. Ergosterol was not detected in roots of uninoculated Betula populifolia seedlings, and sitosterol was not detected in an ectomycorrhizal fungal isolate but was present in birch roots. Ergosterol was produced in all isolates examined, which represented the major orders of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The range of values obtained, from 3 to nearly 18 μg ergosterol mg-1 dry mass, agrees well with reported values for other mycorrhizal and decomposer fungi. Hyphal ergosterol was the same during growth on phytic acid and KH2PO4. Reduction of growth temperature from 25° C to 15° C had little effect on ergosterol content of cultures harvested at similar growth stages. Ergosterol and sitosterol were detected in field-collected ectomycorrhizae of B. populifolia and Pinus sylvestris and VA mycorrhizae of Acer rubrum and Plantago major. Both ergosterol content and ergosterol to sitosterol ratios were significantly lower in VA mycorrhizae than ectomycorrhizae. Calculations of viable fungal biomass associated with field-collected roots were in agreement with those reported by others using the method on resynthesized ectomycorrhizae. Estimates of total mass could be obtained for field-collected B. populifolia roots by a simultaneously using ergosterol to estimate fungal biomass and sitosterol to estimate root mass. Some potential applications and limitations of sterol quantification in studies of mycorrhizal physiology and ecology are discussed.},

  abstract = {Determination of fungal biomass (FB) and FB-carbon (FB-C) from soil ergosterol concentration is difficult because of unknown ergosterol-to-fungal biomass (E-to-FB) conversion factors and inefficient ergosterol extraction methods. We applied a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure to measure ergosterol in soil samples. The E-to-FB conversion factors were determined in six species of fungi grown in vitro. The MAE method was fast and extracted up to nine times more soil ergosterol than a classical refluxing saponification method. Soil ergosterol was separated and quantified rapidly ({$<$}10 min) by HPLC. Alternaria alternata, Chaetomium globosum, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillum chrysogenum, Rhizopus stolonifer and Trichoderma harzianum isolated from soil and plant matrices were grown in batch. Ergosterol and biomass content were determined in mycelia harvested during the stationary and exponential phases of growth. Total mycelial ergosterol ranged from 180 to 2178 μg, and total dry biomass ranged from 17 to 595 mg. Total ergosterol and fungal dry biomass were strongly associated (r2 = 0.95). The C content in mycelial mats averaged 43\% (±1.1, SD), and was similar among fungal species and growth phases. The analyses of variance showed that the E-to-FB ratio was similar among fungal species or growth phase. An average ergosterol concentration of 4 μg mg−1 dry biomass was determined for the six species of fungi, which gave a conversion factor of 250 μg dry biomass μg−1 ergosterol. The MAE method recovered an average of 62\% (±11\%, SD) of the ergosterol added in mycelial mats to soils prior to extraction, and its recovery was independent of soil properties. The E-to-FB ratio and percent recovery of mycelial ergosterol helped establish for the first time relationships determining soil FB and FB-C from soil ergosterol concentration. The amount of FB ranged from 155 to 4745 μg g−1 and that for FB-C ranged from 67 to 2040 μg g−1 for different soils, and was higher in samples taken from native undisturbed land than in samples taken from adjacent cultivated fields. Measurement of soil ergosterol concentration is a useful estimate content of the living soil FB.},

A fungal/bacterial biomass index using the PLFA technique was calculated using the PLFA 18:2ω6,9 as an indicator of fungal biomass and the sum of 13 bacterial specific PLFAs as indicator of the bacterial biomass. Good linear correlation (p{$<$}0.001) was found between the total microbial biomass estimated with SIR and total PLFAs (totPLFA), indicating that 1 mg biomass-C was equivalent to 130nmol totPLFA. Both biomass estimates were positively correlated to soil pH. The fungal/bacterial ratio measured using the selective inhibition technique decreased significantly with increasing pH from about 9 at pH 3 to approximately 2 at pH 7, while the fungal/bacterial biomass index using PLFA measurements tended to increase slightly with increasing soil pH. Good correlation between the soil content of ergosterol and of the PLFA 18:2ω6,9 indicated that the lack of congruency between the two methods in estimating fungal/bacterial ratios was not due to PLFA 18:2ω6,9-related non-fungal structures to any significant degree. Several PLFAs were strongly correlated to soil pH (R2 values {$>$}0.8); for example the PLFAs 16:1ω5 and 16:1ω7c increased with increasing soil pH, while i16:0 and cy19:0 decreased. A principal component analysis of the total PLFA pattern gave a first component that was strongly correlated to soil pH (R2=0.85, p{$<$}0.001) indicating that the microbial community composition in these beech/beech-oak forest soils was to a large extent determined by soil pH.},

Polyphasic studies that used phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) in conjunction with community level physiological profiling (CLPP) or PCR-based molecular methods were analyzed in order to evaluate the power of each strategy to detect treatment effects on soil microbial community structure (MCS). We found no studies where CLPP or PCR-based methods differentiated treatments that were not also differentiated by PLFA. In 14 of 32 studies (44\%), PLFA differentiated treatments that were not resolved by CLPP analysis. In 5 of 25 studies (20\%), PLFA differentiated treatments that were not resolved by PCR-based methods. We discuss PLFA, CLPP, and PCR-based methods with respect to power to discriminate change in MCS versus potential for characterization of underlying population level changes.},

  abstract = {The fungi-to-bacteria ratio in soil ecological concepts and its application to explain the effects of land use changes have gained increasing attention over the past decade. Four different main approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2) selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4) specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass. The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied widely between 2 and 95\% in different data sets published over the past three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76\% in different soil groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers. Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2ω6,9) indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1ω5 content of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific δ13C analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ergosterol has been considered the "fungal sterol" for almost 125 years; however, additional sterol data superimposed on a recent molecular phylogeny of kingdom Fungi reveals a different and more complex situation.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The interpretation of sterol distribution data in a modern phylogenetic context indicates that there is a clear trend from cholesterol and other Delta(5) sterols in the earliest diverging fungal species to ergosterol in later diverging fungi. There are, however, deviations from this pattern in certain clades. Sterols of the diverse zoosporic and zygosporic forms exhibit structural diversity with cholesterol and 24-ethyl -Delta(5) sterols in zoosporic taxa, and 24-methyl sterols in zygosporic fungi. For example, each of the three monophyletic lineages of zygosporic fungi has distinctive major sterols, ergosterol in Mucorales, 22-dihydroergosterol in Dimargaritales, Harpellales, and Kickxellales (DHK clade), and 24-methyl cholesterol in Entomophthorales. Other departures from ergosterol as the dominant sterol include: 24-ethyl cholesterol in Glomeromycota, 24-ethyl cholest-7-enol and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,24(28)-dienol in rust fungi, brassicasterol in Taphrinales and hypogeous pezizalean species, and cholesterol in Pneumocystis.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Five dominant end products of sterol biosynthesis (cholesterol, ergosterol, 24-methyl cholesterol, 24-ethyl cholesterol, brassicasterol), and intermediates in the formation of 24-ethyl cholesterol, are major sterols in 175 species of Fungi. Although most fungi in the most speciose clades have ergosterol as a major sterol, sterols are more varied than currently understood, and their distribution supports certain clades of Fungi in current fungal phylogenies. In addition to the intellectual importance of understanding evolution of sterol synthesis in fungi, there is practical importance because certain antifungal drugs (e.g., azoles) target reactions in the synthesis of ergosterol. These findings also invalidate use of ergosterol as an indicator of biomass of certain fungal taxa (e.g., Glomeromycota). Data from this study are available from the Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life (AFTOL) Structural and Biochemical Database: http://aftol.umn.edu.},

The ascomycetous fungi that dominate cordgrass leaf decomposition processes under natural conditions exhibited a boosting ({$>$}2-fold) of living standing crop (ergosterol content) by misting at the 1 st week after tagging of senescent leaves, but afterwards, living-fungal standing crop on misted blades was equivalent to that on control blades, confirming prior evidence that Spartina fungi are well adapted to natural, irregular wetting. Misting also caused 2-fold sharper temporal declines than control in instantaneous rates of fungal production (ergosterol synthesis), 5-fold declines in density of sexual reproductive structures that were not shown by controls, and 2-fold higher rates of loss of plant organic mass. Extra nitrogen gave a long-term boost to living-fungal standing crop (about 2-fold at 12 weeks), which was also reflected in rates of fungal production at 4 weeks, suggesting that saltmarsh fungal production is nitrogen-limited. Although bacterial and green-microalgal crops were boosted by manipulations of nitrogen and/or water, their maximal crops remained ≤0.3 or 2\% (bacteria or green microalgae, respectively) of contemporaneous living-fungal crop. The fungal carbon-productivity values obtained, in conjunction with rates of loss of plant carbon, hinted that fungal yield can be high ({$>$}50\%), and that it is boosted by high availability of nitrogen. We speculate that one partial cause of high fungal yield could be subsidy of fungal growth by dissolved organic carbon from outside decomposing leaves.},

For any single growth medium, ergosterol content of mycelium was less variable with mycelial age than has been previously found for glucosamine. For Leptosphaeria obiones, ergosterol content in solid medium was estimated to be similar to that in semi-natural liquid, but for Phaeosphaeria typharum, solid medium yielded much higher (× 5) ergosterol estimates, possibly due to underestimated mycelial mass. Partial mycelial autolysis led to low estimates of ergosterol content (1.1 mg g\textsuperscript{-1} dry organic). Bacteria had negligible ergosterol contents, but there was evidence that green-microalgal ergosterol content might not be negligible in some decomposition systems.},

Media included an aqueous extract from senescent alder leaves, a malt extract broth, and a glucose-mineral salt solution. Concentrations of ergosterol in fungal mycelium ranged from 2.3 to 11.5 mg/g of dry mass. The overall average was 5.5 mg/g. Differences among both species and growth media were highly significant but followed no systematic pattern. Stationary-phase mycelium had ergosterol contents 10 to 12\% lower or higher than mycelium harvested during the growth phase, but these differences were only significant for one of four species examined. Availability of plant sterols in the growth medium had no clear effect on ergosterol concentrations in two species tested. To convert ergosterol contents determined in field samples to biomass values of aquatic hyphomycetes, a general multiplicative factor of 182 is proposed. More accurate estimates would be obtained with species-specific factors. Using these in combination with estimates of the proportion of the dominant species in a naturally established community on leaves resulted in biomass estimates that were typically 20\% lower than those obtained with the general conversion factor. Improvements of estimates with species-specific factors may be limited, however, by intraspecific variability in fungal ergosterol content.},

An average of 1.40×10-17 mol bacterial PLFA cell-1 was found in bacteria extracted from 15 soils covering a wide range of pH and organic matter contents. With this factor, the bacterial biomass based on PLFA analyses of whole soil samples was calculated as 1.0–4.8 mg bacterial C g-1 soil C. The corresponding range based on microscopical counts was 0.3–3.0 mg bacterial C g-1 soil C. The recovery of bacteria from the soils using homogenization/centrifugation was 2.6–16\% (mean 8.7\%) measured by PLFA analysis, and 12–61\% (mean 26\%) measured as microscopical counts. The soil content of the PLFA 18:2ω6 was correlated with the ergosterol content (r=0.92), which supports the use of this PLFA as an indicator of fungal biomass. The ratio 18:2ω6 to bacterial PLFA is therefore suggested as an index of the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio in soil. An advantage with the method based on PLFA analyses is that the same technique and even the same sample is used to determine both fungi and bacteria. The fungal:bacterial biomass ratio calculated in this way was positively correlated with the organic matter content of the soils (r=0.94).},

  abstract = {Eleven species of common fungi from compost were analysed for their content of ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) after growth on agar media. Mean content of ergosterol was 3.1 mg g−1dw of fungal mycelium (range 1–24 mg g−1dw). Total amount of PLFAs varied between 2.6 and 43.5 μmolg−1dw of fungi (mean 14.9μmolg−1dw). The most common PLFAs were 16:0, 18:2ω6,9 and 18:1ω9, comprising between 79 and 97mol\% of the total amount of PLFAs. The PLFA 18:2ω6,9, suggested as a marker molecule for fungi, comprised between 36 and 61mol\% of the total PLFAs in the Ascomycetes, between 45 and 57mol\% in the Basidiomycetes and 12–22mol\% in the Zygomycetes. There was a good correlation between the content of the two fungal marker molecules, ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2ω6,9, with a mean content of 1 mg ergosterol being equivalent to 2.1μmol of 18:2ω6,9. Based on results from the fungal isolates, conversion factors were calculated (5.4 mg ergosterolg−1 biomass C and 11.8μmol 18:2ω6,9 g−1 biomass C) and applied to compost samples in which both the ergosterol and the PLFA 18:2ω6,9 content had been measured. This resulted in similar estimates of fungal biomass C using the two marker molecules, but was three to five times higher than total microbial biomass C calculated using ATP content in the compost. This could partly be explained by the fact that both of the markers used for fungal biomass are cell membrane constituents. Thus, the ergosterol and the PLFA content were related to the hyphal diameter of the fungi, where fungi with thinner hyphae had higher ergosterol concentrations than fungi with thicker hyphae. This could also partly explain the large interspecific variation in content of the two marker molecules.},

Little is known, however, about the structure and richness of different fungal communities and the distribution of functional ecological groups (pathogens, saprobes and symbionts). • Here, we assessed the fungal diversity in six different forest soils using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1). No less than 166 350 ITS reads were obtained from all samples. In each forest soil sample (4 g), approximately 30 000 reads were recovered, corresponding to around 1000 molecular operational taxonomic units. • Most operational taxonomic units (81\%) belonged to the Dikarya subkingdom (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Richness, abundance and taxonomic analyses identified the Agaricomycetes as the dominant fungal class. The ITS-1 sequences (73\%) analysed corresponded to only 26 taxa. The most abundant operational taxonomic units showed the highest sequence similarity to Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptococcus podzolicus, Lactarius sp. and Scleroderma sp. • This study validates the effectiveness of high-throughput 454 sequencing technology for the survey of soil fungal diversity. The large proportion of unidentified sequences, however, calls for curated sequence databases. The use of pyrosequencing on soil samples will accelerate the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of fungal communities in forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Fungi are an important and diverse component of soil communities, but these communities have proven difficult to study in conventional biotic surveys. We evaluated soil fungal diversity at two sites in a temperate forest using direct isolation of small-subunit and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA genes by PCR and high-throughput sequencing of cloned fragments. We identified 412 sequence types from 863 fungal ITS sequences, as well as 112 ITS sequences from other eukaryotic microorganisms. Equal proportions of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota sequences were present in both the ITS and small-subunit libraries, while members of other fungal phyla were recovered at much lower frequencies. Many sequences closely matched sequences from mycorrhizal, plant-pathogenic, and saprophytic fungi. Compositional differences were observed among samples from different soil depths, with mycorrhizal species predominating deeper in the soil profile and saprophytic species predominating in the litter layer. Richness was consistently lowest in the deepest soil horizon samples. Comparable levels of fungal richness have been observed following traditional specimen-based collecting and culturing surveys, but only after much more extensive sampling. The high rate at which new sequence types were recovered even after sampling 863 fungal ITS sequences and the dominance of fungi in our libraries relative to other eukaryotes suggest that the abundance and diversity of fungi in forest soils may be much higher than previously hypothesized.},

  abstract = {Background Internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) is already one of the most popular phylogenetic and DNA barcoding markers. However, the existence of its multiple copies has complicated such usage and a detailed characterization of intra-genomic variations is critical to address such concerns. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we used sequence-tagged pyrosequencing and genome-wide analyses to characterize intra-genomic variations of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions from 178 plant species. We discovered that mutation of ITS2 is frequent, with a mean of 35 variants per species. And on average, three of the most abundant variants make up 91\% of all ITS2 copies. Moreover, we found different congeneric species share identical variants in 13 genera. Interestingly, different species across different genera also share identical variants. In particular, one minor variant of ITS2 in Eleutherococcus giraldii was found identical to the ITS2 major variant of Panax ginseng, both from Araliaceae family. In addition, DNA barcoding gap analysis showed that the intra-genomic distances were markedly smaller than those of the intra-specific or inter-specific variants. When each of 5543 variants were examined for its species discrimination efficiency, a 97\% success rate was obtained at the species level. Conclusions Identification of identical ITS2 variants across intra-generic or inter-generic species revealed complex species evolutionary history, possibly, horizontal gene transfer and ancestral hybridization. Although intra-genomic multiple variants are frequently found within each genome, the usage of the major variants alone is sufficient for phylogeny construction and species determination in most cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of minor variants further improves the resolution of species identification.},

  abstract = {The ribosomal DNA's of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus mulleri differ in their nucleotide sequences. Their base compositions are 67 and 65\% G + C, respectively. The nucleotide sequences which code for 28 s and 18 s ribosomal RNA in the rDNA of the two species could not be distinguished by their size, base composition, or fidelity of hybridization. The difference between the two ribosomal DNA's lies in their spacer regions. Complementary RNA transcribed from spacer regions hybridized to heterologous rDNA at less than 20\% of the level with which it hybridized to homologous rDNA. Partly denatured molecules of the two rDNA's were further compared by “denaturation mapping” in the electron microscope. The repeat length in X. mulleri rDNA is about the same as that in X. laevis rDNA. While the regions presumed to code for the 40 s precursor of rRNA have very similar denaturation patterns in the ribosomal DNA of X. laevis and X. mulleri, the patterns in the spacer regions are very different. Both physico-chemical and electron microscopic analyses show that the repeating sequences in X. mulleri ribosomal DNA are very similar, if not identical, to each other with respect to size and nucleotide sequence, a fact previously demonstrated for the rDNA of X. laevis. The multiple spacer sequences interspersed between the 18 s and 28 s gene regions have evolved together; the 18 s and 28 s genes have remained unchanged. Although the spacer regions differ greatly between species, they are very similar if not identical within each species. We conclude that a “correction” mechanism must operate to spread a mutation in one spacer sequence to the neighboring spacers faster than new changes arise in these genes. This phenomenon, which occurs within a single organism, is referred to as “horizontal” evolution, in contrast to “vertical” evolution which is the spread of a mutation through a breeding population.},

  abstract = {Our aim was to determine if soil ergosterol concentration provides a quantitative estimate of the soil fungal biomass concentration, as is usually assumed. This was done by comparing soil ergosterol measurements with soil fungal biomass (fungal biomass C) concentrations estimated by microscopic measurements and by the selective inhibition technique linked to substrate-induced respiration (SIR). The measurements were compared in a silty–clay loam soil given a range of previous treatments designed to increase or decrease the soil fungal biomass and so also to change the soil ergosterol concentration. The treatments used were ryegrass amendment, to increase the total and fungal biomass, and CHCl3-fumigation and the addition of the biocides, captan, bronopol and dinoseb, to decrease both ergosterol and fungal biomass C concentrations. The mineralization of ergosterol following addition to sand innoculated with soil extract, and to a sandy loam soil, was also determined. The added ergosterol was little, if at all, degraded following addition to either sand or the unfumigated or fumigated soil during a 10d aerobic incubation. Similarly, pesticide addition did not significantly change soil ergosterol concentrations yet the soil fungal biomass C concentration decreased significantly. Thus, the ratio: (soil ergosterol concentration/soil fungal biomass C concentration) was much higher in the pesticide-treated soils than the control soil. Following ryegrass amendment, soil ergosterol concentration increased from about 6–12μg−1 soil within 5d and then decreased gradually to about 7μgg−1 soil by 20d incubation. Changes in fungal biomass C (measured by direct microscopy) closely mirrored changes in soil ergosterol over this period. However, when the amended soil was fumigated and then incubated for a further 5d, the initial ergosterol concentration declined from 7 to 5μgg−1 soil by 20d incubation (a decline of about 0.4). The comparable decline in fungal biomass C was about eight-fold. Thus the ratio of ergosterol to fungal biomass C increased from 0.005 to about 0.01. There was a significant correlation (r{$>$}0.84, P{$<$}0.001) between soil ergosterol concentration and fungal biomass measured by either SIR or microscopy. However, three data points played a vital role in the correlation. When these points were excluded the relationship was very poor (r{$<$}0.4). Our results therefore suggest that substantial amounts of ergosterol may exist, other than in living cells, for considerable periods, with little, if any mineralization. Thus, these results indicate that ergosterol and fungal biomass C concentrations are not always closely correlated, due to the slow metabolism of ergosterol in recently dead fugal biomass and/or the existence of exocellular ergosterol in soil.},

Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258,411 RNA-tags of ∼98 bp length contained 193,219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information, together with 21,133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa, such as soil Crenarchaeota, were well represented in the data set. These were identified by more than 2,000 rRNA-tags; furthermore, their activity in situ was revealed through the presence of mRNA-tags specific for enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation and CO2 fixation.Conclusions/SignificanceThis approach could be widely applied in microbial ecology by efficiently linking community structure and function in a single experiment while avoiding biases inherent in other methods.},

Such a library contains genes that are expressed by each of the different organisms forming the community and represents its metatranscriptome. The diversity of the organisms that contributed to this library was evaluated by sequencing a portion of the 18S rDNA gene amplified from either soil DNA or reverse-transcribed RNA. More than 70\% of the sequences were from fungi and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) while the other most represented group was the metazoa. Calculation of richness estimators suggested that more than 180 species could be present in the soil samples studied. Sequencing of 119 cDNA identified genes with no homologues in databases (32\%) and genes coding proteins involved in different biochemical and cellular processes. Surprisingly, the taxonomic distribution of the cDNA and of the 18S rDNA genes did not coincide, with a marked under-representation of the protists among the cDNA. Specific genes from such an environmental cDNA library could be isolated by expression in a heterologous microbial host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is illustrated by the functional complementation of a histidine auxotrophic yeast mutant by two cDNA originating possibly from an ascomycete and a basidiomycete fungal species. Study of the metatranscriptome has the potential to uncover adaptations of whole microbial communities to local environmental conditions. It also gives access to an abundant source of genes of biotechnological interest.},

  abstract = {Here we describe the application of metagenomic technologies to construct cDNA libraries from RNA isolated from environmental samples. RNAlater (Ambion) was shown to stabilize RNA in environmental samples for periods of at least 3 months at −20°C. Protocols for library construction were established on total RNA extracted from Acanthamoeba polyphaga trophozoites. The methodology was then used on algal mats from geothermal hot springs in Tengchong county, Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, and activated sludge from a sewage treatment plant in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. The Tenchong libraries were dominated by RNA from prokaryotes, reflecting the mainly prokaryote microbial composition. The majority of these clones resulted from rRNA; only a few appeared to be derived from mRNA. In contrast, many clones from the activated sludge library had significant similarity to eukaryote mRNA-encoded protein sequences. A library was also made using polyadenylated RNA isolated from total RNA from activated sludge; many more clones in this library were related to eukaryotic mRNA sequences and proteins. Open reading frames (ORFs) up to 378 amino acids in size could be identified. Some resembled known proteins over their full length, e.g., 36\% match to cystatin, 49\% match to ribosomal protein L32, 63\% match to ribosomal protein S16, 70\% to CPC2 protein. The methodology described here permits the polyadenylated transcriptome to be isolated from environmental samples with no knowledge of the identity of the microorganisms in the sample or the necessity to culture them. It has many uses, including the identification of novel eukaryotic ORFs encoding proteins and enzymes.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic organisms play essential roles in the biology and fertility of soils. For example the micro and mesofauna contribute to the fragmentation and homogenization of plant organic matter, while its hydrolysis is primarily performed by the fungi. To get a global picture of the activities carried out by soil eukaryotes we sequenced 2×10,000 cDNAs synthesized from polyadenylated mRNA directly extracted from soils sampled in beech (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce (Picea abies) forests. Taxonomic affiliation of both cDNAs and 18S rRNA sequences showed a dominance of sequences from fungi (up to 60\%) and metazoans while protists represented less than 12\% of the 18S rRNA sequences. Sixty percent of cDNA sequences from beech forest soil and 52\% from spruce forest soil had no homologs in the GenBank/EMBL/DDJB protein database. A Gene Ontology term was attributed to 39\% and 31.5\% of the spruce and beech soil sequences respectively. Altogether 2076 sequences were putative homologs to different enzyme classes participating to 129 KEGG pathways among which several were implicated in the utilisation of soil nutrients such as nitrogen (ammonium, amino acids, oligopeptides), sugars, phosphates and sulfate. Specific annotation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes identified enzymes active on major polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin) and glycoside hydrolases represented 0.5\% (beech soil)–0.8\% (spruce soil) of the cDNAs. Other sequences coding enzymes active on organic matter (extracellular proteases, lipases, a phytase, P450 monooxygenases) were identified, thus underlining the biotechnological potential of eukaryotic metatranscriptomes. The phylogenetic affiliation of 12 full-length carbohydrate active enzymes showed that most of them were distantly related to sequences from known fungi. For example, a putative GH45 endocellulase was closely associated to molluscan sequences, while a GH7 cellobiohydrolase was closest to crustacean sequences, thus suggesting a potentially significant contribution of non-fungal eukaryotes in the actual hydrolysis of soil organic matter.},

In particular, our understanding of the daunting diversity of soil microbes has grown to maturity, opening up a new box of challenging research questions about microbial functioning and interactions. We here review recent developments in, as well as the state-of-the-art of, the molecular methods applied to soil, and discuss a few salient cases in which they have enhanced our understanding of the soil microbiota and its functioning. In particular, we place a focus on the interface between soil fungal hyphae and the corresponding non-fungal-affected soil, i.e., the mycosphere. This selective environment may reduce the diversity of its inhabitants, allowing an improved picture of their ecology and functioning via molecular techniques. We present arguments for the contention that, to investigate testable hypotheses, a polyphasic approach is needed, in which work on the basis of molecular approaches such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics is coupled to that based on culturable organisms. Thus, advances in our understanding of local functioning and adaptation of bacterial mycosphere inhabitants will be fostered by combined metagenomics/metatranscriptomics and cultivation-based approaches.},

We highlight current approaches for analysis of fungal transcriptome and metatranscriptome datasets across a gradient of community complexity, and note benefits and pitfalls associated with those approaches.

This information has not only increased our awareness of the functional potential of soil microbial communities, but also constitutes powerful reference material for soil metatranscriptomics studies. Metatranscriptomics provides a snapshot of transcriptional profiles that correspond to discrete populations within a microbial community at the time of sampling. This information can indicate the potential activities of complex microbial communities and the mechanisms that regulate them.

While taxonomic analysis is performed based on the NCBI taxonomy, functional analysis is performed using the SEED classification of subsystems and functional roles or the KEGG classification of pathways and enzymes.

  abstract = {Microbial ecologists have used direct RT-PCR amplification of 16S rRNA molecules for the detection of active species of bacteria and archaea, and 18S rRNA molecules for the detection of active fungi. The drawback to this approach for fungi is that 18S rRNA sequences often do not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to allow identification of taxa in mixed communities to genus or species level. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences are known to be more taxonomically informative than 18S rRNA sequences and are the common target in DNA based studies but are thought to be absent from RNA pools as they are cleaved after transcription of the large rRNA precursor molecule to leave the mature rRNA's for ribosome synthesis. Here we show, however, that fungal ITS regions can be detected in RNA pools by RT-PCR amplification of fungal precursor rRNA molecules. This suggests that precursor rRNA molecules reside in the cells of active fungi for sufficient time to allow RT-PCR amplification of ITS regions prior to their removal by post-transcriptional cleavage. The RT-PCR conditions for this approach were initially optimised using a range of fungi grown in pure culture prior to applying the approach to complex fungal communities in two contrasting soil types.},

  abstract = {Soils of coniferous forest ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle, and the identification of active microbial decomposers is essential for understanding organic matter transformation in these ecosystems. By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon. Cellulose decomposition is mediated by highly diverse fungal populations largely distinct between soil horizons. The results indicate that low-abundance species make an important contribution to decomposition processes in soils.},

Fungal communities include quiescent taxa and the functionally important and metabolically active taxa that respond to changes in the environment. To determine fungal community shifts along a tree species diversity gradient, needles of Norway spruce were sampled from trees from four mature European forests. We hypothesized that the fungal communities and specific fungal taxa would correlate with tree species diversity. Furthermore, the active fungal community, and not the total community, would shift along the tree diversity gradient. High-throughput sequencing showed significant differences in the fungal communities in the different forests, and in one forest, tree diversity effects were observed, though this was not a general phenomenon. Our study also suggests that studying the metabolically active community may not provide additional information about community composition or diversity.},

C. geophilum still holds a significant set of genes in categories known to be involved in pathogenesis and shows an increased genome size due to transposable elements proliferation. Transcript profiling revealed a striking upregulation of membrane transporters, including aquaporin water channels and sugar transporters, and mycorrhiza-induced small secreted proteins (MiSSPs) in ectomycorrhiza compared with free-living mycelium. The frequency with which this symbiont is found on tree roots and its possible role in water and nutrient transport in symbiosis calls for further studies on mechanisms of host and environmental adaptation.},

  abstract = {Resolving species delimitation issues of European Cantharellus is crucial to correctly name chanterelles around the globe. Thirty names referring to Cantharellus s. str. have been described in Europe, some of which are used in other continents. Based on combined analyses of ITS2, LSU, RPB2 and TEF-1, merely eight species are here recognized in Europe applying the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition criteria, one of which, C. roseofagetorum, is described as new. Morphological characters used in species delimitation are mapped and their variability evaluated. The colour of the hymenophore in young specimens is found to be a rather constant morphological character of taxonomic use. European species of Cantharellus are morphologically distinguished by unique combinations of characters, such as the presence of a pink pileal coating, pileus and hymenophore colour when young, and in some cases, the mean spore length and ecology. Eighteen type specimens from Europe are sequenced. Based on revised species concepts sixteen novel taxonomic synonyms are here proposed for European chanterelles: C. alborufescens (= C. henrici, C. ilicis, C. lilacinopruinatus), C. amethysteus (= C. cibarius subsp. squamulosus, C. cibarius var. umbrinus, C. rufipes), C. cibarius (= C. cibarius var. atlanticus, C. parviluteus), C. ferruginascens (= C. cibarius var. flavipes), C. friesii (= C. ignescens), C. pallens (= C. cibarius var. albidus, C. cibarius var. bicolor, C. subpruinosus), and C. romagnesianus (= C. pseudominimus, C. lourizanianus, C. romagnesianus var. parvisporus). The type of Cantharellus, C. cibarius, is epitypified. Descriptions, colour illustrations and a key to all European species are provided.},

Six subgenera are recognized and the recognition of subgenus Afrocantharellus as a separate genus is not accepted. The taxonomic value of individual morphological features is discussed as challenged by this new multigene phylogeny which comprises five new sections, one new subgenus and many emendations for previously recognized infrageneric groups. The paper discusses the observed discrepancy in biodiversity of Cantharellus when comparing between studies that focus either on below- or above-ground presence. A preliminary biogeographic hypothesis suggests an ‘out of Africa’ Gondwanan origin as a result of vicariance and subsequent migrations.},

  abstract = {Fungi combine sexual reproduction and clonal propagation. The balance between these two reproductive modes affects establishment dynamics, and ultimately the evolutionary potential of populations. The pattern of colonization was studied in two species of ectomycorrhizal fungi: Tricholoma populinum and Tricholoma scalpturatum. The former is considered to be a host specialist whereas T. scalpturatum is a generalist taxon. Fruit bodies of both basidiomycete species were mapped and collected over several years from a black poplar (Populus nigra) stand, at two different sites. Multilocus genotypes (= genets) were identified based on the analysis of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) patterns and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer (rDNA IGS). The genetic analyses revealed differences in local population dynamics between the two species. Tricholoma scalpturatum tended to capture new space through sexual spores whereas T. populinum did this by clonal growth, suggesting trade-offs in allocation of resources at the genet level. Genet numbers and sizes strongly differ between the two study sites, perhaps as a result of abiotic disturbance on mycelial establishment and genet behaviour.},

  abstract = {The basidiomycete mushroom Hebeloma cylindrosporum is a frequently found pioneer ectomycorrhizal species naturally associated with Pinus pinaster trees growing in coastal sand dune ecosystems along the Atlantic south-west coast of France. The genotypic diversity and spatial structure of three populations of this fungal species have been studied. At each site the basidiocarps were mapped, sampled and propagated as pure mycelial cultures. For each of the isolates, we have studied polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome, polymorphisms at two different nuclear loci and also fingerprints produced with a multicopy DNA probe. The comparison of the different polymorphisms obtained, with each of the four molecular methods used, allowed the identification of several of the different genets present in each site. In two of the studied sites most of the basidiocarps, which often occurred as dense patches of 10–30 in 1 m2 or less, were of a unique genotype, suggesting the below-ground mycelia to be of a small size (from 50 cm2 to approx. 7 m2 for the larger mycelia) and that the root system of a single Pinus tree can host several genets of the same symbiotic fungus. In the two sites, which were studied again after a 3-year interval, none of the genotypes identified in the first year of sampling was re-identified 3 years later. These results contrast with those reported for other species of soilborne homobasidiomycete species, either ectomycorrhizal, parasitic or saprophytic, showing mostly large clones resulting from the vegetative growth and from persistence of below-ground mycelia. Sexual reproduction through meiospore dispersal seems to play a key role in the structuring of the populations of H. cylindrosporum. Mycelia associated with the root systems seem to be replaced after 1 or a few years, during which basidiocarp differentiation takes place. As opposed to the few other studied ectomycorrhizal species, H. cylindrosporum has the characteristics of ruderal species, with a short life-span adapted to pioneer situations, e.g. to nutrient-poor and unstable sandy soils of coastal sand dunes.},

The reason for this can be explained in part by their cryptic nature and difficulty in identifying genets. In addition the difficulty (relative to plants and animals) in developing molecular markers for fungal population genetics contributes to the lack of research in this area. This study examines the ability of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to generate SNPs in Laccaria bicolor. Eighteen samples of morphologically identified L. bicolor from the United States and Europe were selected for this project. The RAD sequencing method produced anywhere from 290 000 to more than 3 000 000 reads. Mapping these reads to the genome of L. bicolor resulted in 84 000–940 000 unique reads from individual samples. Results indicate that incorporation of non-L. bicolor taxa into the analysis resulted in a precipitous drop in shared loci among samples, suggests the potential of these methods to identify cryptic species. F-statistics were easily calculated, although an observable “noise” was detected when using the “All Loci” treatment versus filtering loci to those present in at least 50\% of the individuals. The data were analyzed with tests of Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium, population genetic statistics (FIS and FST), and population structure analysis using the program Structure. The results provide encouraging feedback regarding the potential utility of these methods and their data for population genetic analysis. We were unable to draw conclusions of life history of L. bicolor populations from this dataset, given the small sample size. The results of this study indicate the potential of these methods to address population genetics and general life history questions in the Agaricales. Further research is necessary to explore the specific application of these methods in the Agaricales or other fungal groups.},

  abstract = {For the very first time, morpho-anatomical features of both fruiting bodies as well as below-ground structures have been confronted with a newly produced multigene phylogeny of root symbiotic basidiomycetes using one of the most speciose genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Russula, Russulales) as an example. In this first of two papers, the authors focus more specifically on below-ground structures. Our five-gene phylogeny divides the genus in five main clades, here interpreted as representing seven subgenera, all significantly supported. Although more conserved than features of fruiting bodies, the anatomy of ectomycorrhiza does not allow for an unambiguous characterization of the main clades resolved by phylogenetic analysis, but the anatomy of ectomycorrhiza performs better to naturally classify the species of this genus. Features of fruiting bodies remain much more adequate for the delimitation of terminal clades and are irreplaceable for morphological species identification. Tropical taxa mostly nest in ancient lineages, but are also present in some terminal clades of otherwise temperate species groups. The shift from plectenchymatic to pseudoparenchymatic ECM outer mantle structures happened most likely already in the paleotropics, and is here hypothesized to have facilitated a major diversification of the genus with new hosts in the northern hemisphere. Available data as well as our own observations on below ground structures of several Lactifluus species suggests that this genus shares with Russula the absence of lactifers in ECM mantles and rhizomorphs, contrary to species of Lactarius where lactifers are always present. First observations on rhizomorphs of species in Multifurca confirm the presence of vessel-like and ladder-like hyphae, also found in the other agarioid genera of this family, while distinct lactifers are only present in the lactarioid, but not in russuloid members of this genus.},

Morphological characters and DNA sequence data support its placement in Lactarius subgen. Plinthogali. Molecular kinship analyses confirm a multiple origin of sequestrate Russulaceae spp. As none of the previously sequenced sequestrate Russulaceae spp. has been assigned to the Plinthogali clade, the placement of L. angiocarpus indicates an additional point of origin of derivative sporocarp types within the Russulaceae. Within the same subgenus, another tropical African sequestrate species, L. dolichocaulis comb. nov. (syn. Arcangeliella dolichocaulis) is recognized.},

  abstract = {A data set of LSU DNA sequences of mainly European Russula and Lactarius species was subjected to molecular phylogenetic analysis. Species could be allocated to six clades, with an unresolved phylogeny. One of these clades represents the genus Lactarius. The only analysed species of the section Archaeinae (Russula) was placed basal to both genera. Thus Lactarius appears to be derived from Russula. Russula was divided into four clusters, corresponding to the sections Plorantinae and Nigricantinae, subgenus Heterophyllidia including the section Foetentinae, and a cluster representing the remaining subgenera of the “Genuinae”. Even though the resulting groups can be considered as valid classificatory groups, species associations resulting from molecular analyses neither support the division of Russula into the subgenus Compacta (including the sections Nigricantinae, Plorantinae, and Archaeinae) and the “Genuinae” (including all remaining taxa), nor do they support previously proposed evolutionary lineages within the “Genuinae”. Ribosomal ITS DNA sequences of Russula species were analysed to achieve better infrageneric resolution. The results are discussed in relation to current classification systems and to what is known about the mycorrhizae formed by Russula species. While the systematic value attached to many macroscopic and microscopic sporocarp features was not supported by sequence data, mycorrhizal anatomy is in good correspondence with many of the results from the phylogenetic analysis.},

Seven taxa in Coprinus (C. comatus, C. atramentarius, C. cinereus, C. micaceus, C. cordisporus, C. plicatilis, C. curtus), five potential sister group taxa (Psathyrella gracilis, Panaeolus semiovatus, Bolbitius vitellinus, Agrocybe praecox, Stropharia rugosoannulata), and two secotioid taxa (Podaxis pistillaris and Montagnea arenaria) were investigated. Restriction analysis was carried out on enzymatically amplified portions of the nuclear gene coding for the large ribosomal subunit RNA and the internally transcribed spacer region II. A total of 153 sites were mapped, of which 54 were phylogenetically informative. Six equally-most parsimonious networks were resolved using cladistic methods. One of these six networks was identified as best supported using a stepmatrix to weight restriction site gains over losses (character-state weighting). This tree demonstrates that: 1, the genus Coprinus is at least paraphyletic and probably polyphyletic; 2, Psathyrella is derived from within Coprinus; 3, the two secotioid taxa are closely related to Coprinus comatus; and, 4, the sister genus to Coprinus is Bolbitius. The branches of the character-state weighted tree have support similar to identical branches from the equally weighted tree as evidenced by three robustness indices. The character-state weighted tree provides a phylogenetic hypothesis similar to a strict consensus tree from unweighted parsimony analysis, but has the advantage of being fully resolved and thus provides a more detailed hypothesis for future research.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is omnipresent in boreal forests, where it is assumed to benefit plant growth. However, experiments show inconsistent benefits for plants and volatility of individual partnerships, which calls for a re-evaluation of the presumed role of this symbiosis. We reconcile these inconsistencies by developing a model that demonstrates how mycorrhizal networking and market mechanisms shape the strategies of individual plants and fungi to promote symbiotic stability at the ecosystem level. The model predicts that plants switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines, in agreement with the frequency distribution of ectomycorrhizal colonization intensity across a wide-ranging data set. In line with observations in field-scale isotope labeling experiments, the model explains why ectomycorrhizal symbiosis does not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation. Instead, market mechanisms may generate self-stabilization of the mycorrhizal strategy via nitrogen depletion feedback, even if plant growth is ultimately reduced. We suggest that this feedback mechanism maintains the strong nitrogen limitation ubiquitous in boreal forests. The mechanism may also have the capacity to eliminate or even reverse the expected positive effect of rising CO2 on tree growth in strongly nitrogen-limited boreal forests.},

  abstract = {The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, formed between the majority of land plants and ubiquitous soil fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota, is responsible for massive nutrient transfer and global carbon sequestration. AM fungi take up nutrients from the soil and exchange them against photosynthetically fixed carbon (C) from the host. Recent studies have demonstrated that reciprocal reward strategies by plant and fungal partners guarantee a “fair trade” of phosphorus against C between partners [Kiers ET, et al. (2011) Science 333:880–882], but whether a similar reward mechanism also controls nitrogen (N) flux in the AM symbiosis is not known. Using mycorrhizal root organ cultures, we manipulated the C supply to the host and fungus and followed the uptake and transport of N sources in the AM symbiosis, the enzymatic activities of arginase and urease, and fungal gene expression in the extraradical and intraradical mycelium. We found that the C supply of the host plant triggers the uptake and transport of N in the symbiosis, and that the increase in N transport is orchestrated by changes in fungal gene expression. N transport in the symbiosis is stimulated only when the C is delivered by the host across the mycorrhizal interface, not when C is supplied directly to the fungal extraradical mycelium in the form of acetate. These findings support the importance of C flux from the root to the fungus as a key trigger for N uptake and transport and provide insight into the N transport regulation in the AM symbiosis.},

This increases the potential for exploitation and defection by individuals, raising the question of how partners maintain a fair, two-way transfer of resources. We manipulated cooperation in plants and fungal partners to show that plants can detect, discriminate, and reward the best fungal partners with more carbohydrates. In turn, their fungal partners enforce cooperation by increasing nutrient transfer only to those roots providing more carbohydrates. On the basis of these observations we conclude that, unlike many other mutualisms, the symbiont cannot be “enslaved.” Rather, the mutualism is evolutionarily stable because control is bidirectional, and partners offering the best rate of exchange are rewarded.
Plants and their associated fungi reward partners that offer the best resources to sustain mutualism in complex systems.

Although it is recognized that the fungus depends on the host for its carbon supply6,7, the functional relationship between the partners has not been investigated fully. Transport of 32P through rhizomorphs has been demonstrated8, but their potential to absorb and transport water is not known. We have synthesized mycorrhizal rhizomorphs in association with pine, and preliminary experiments with tritiated water (3H2O) showed that the cut distal ends could absorb water which was transported to mycorrhizal roots and to seedling needles9. We have since developed a method for feeding 3H2O to the intact terminal portions of rhizomorphs in sealed vessels with negligible disturbance to the mycelial system, and we report here that mycorrhizal rhizomorphs can absorb water and facilitate its transport over ecologically significant distances. Electron microscopy shows that the rhizomorphs are differentiated structures with large central ‘vessel’ hyphae.},

This review provides an overview of our knowledge on the effects of toxic concentrations of metals on ectomycorrhizal populations and communities.• Discussion Selection and adaptations within particular ectomycorrhizal species that colonise host plants in harsh environments is discussed. Among these adaptations, we focus on the metal exclusion strategy that is discovered in metal-tolerant ecotypes of Suillus species that thrive on metalliferous soils. Metal efflux in metal-tolerant ecotypes prevents metal overloading of cytoplasm and vacuole. At the same time, this metal-specific efflux system in Suillus seems to reduce the transfer of large quantities of metals towards the plant–fungus interface, without hampering normal nutrient transfer to the host plant.• Conclusion The evolutionary adaptation in Suillus species contributes to the survival of host trees on metalliferous soils and might be exploited in phytostabilisation strategies for heavy metal-contaminated soils.},

  abstract = {• Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are often considered to be most prevalent under conditions where organic sources of N predominate. However, ECM fungi are increasingly exposed to nitrate from anthropogenic sources. Currently, the ability of ECM fungi to metabolize this nitrate is poorly understood. • Here, growth was examined among 106 isolates, representing 68 species, of ECM fungi on nitrate as the sole N source. In addition, the occurrence of genes coding for the nitrate reductase enzyme (nar gene) in a broad range of ectomycorrhizal fungi was investigated. • All isolates grew on nitrate, but there was a strong taxonomic signature in the biomass production, with the Russulaceae and Amanita showing the lowest growth. Thirty-five partial nar sequences were obtained from 43 tested strains comprising 31 species and 10 genera. These taxa represent three out of the four clades of the Agaricales within which ECM fungi occur. No nar sequences were recovered from the Russulaceae and Amanita, but Southern hybridization showed that the genes were present. • The results demonstrate that the ability to utilize nitrate as an N source is widespread in ECM fungi, even in those fungi from boreal forests where the supply of nitrate may be very low.},

Isotopic profiles of C. cinnabarinum resembled those of ectomycorrhizal fungi but not those of saprotrophic fungi. For molecular analyses, ectomycorrhizal root tips were extracted from soil cores collected beneath C.~cinnabarinum fruit bodies. Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) sequences were obtained from ectomycorrhizal root tips using fungal-specific primers and screened against C.~cinnabarinum nrITS sequences.

By using molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction, we were able to identify the fungal symbionts directly from mycorrhizae in nearly all of the mycorrhizal morphotypes we found. Most species were either rare or low in abundance.

Nous récoltons carpophores et ectomycorhizes pendant 4 années. À l'aide d'outils moléculaires basés sur la réaction de polymérase en chaîne, nous pouvons déterminer les symbiontes fongiques directement à partir des mycorhizes pour la grande majorité des types morphologiques de mycorhizes. La grande majorité des espèces rencontrées sont rares ou peu abondantes. Parmi les espèces les plus communes, nous observons trois types de situations : (i) des espèces comme Russula xerampelina s.l. et Amanita francheti sont bien représentées à la fois au niveau des carpophores et des mycorhizes; (ii) quelques espèces qui fructifient abondamment comme Suillus pungens forment peu de mycorhizes; (...},

  abstract = {• Studies of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in forest soils are usually restricted to the uppermost organic horizons. Boreal forest podzols are highly stratified and little is known about the vertical distribution of ectomycorrhizal communities in the underlying mineral horizons. • Ectomycorrhizal root tips were sampled from seven horizons in three continuous columns of a 52-cm deep podzol profile. Root tips were sorted into morphological groups and the colonising fungi identified by sequencing of the rDNA ITS region. The vertical distribution of mycorrhizal taxa was examined. • A relationship between ectomycorrhizal species composition and soil horizon was found. Tomentellopsis submollis, three Piloderma species and Dermocybe spp. were found predominantly in the upper horizons while Suillus luteus, Lactarius utilis and three undescribed Piloderma species were associated with the mineral horizons. • Two thirds of the root tips were found in the mineral soil and half of the taxa were restricted to the mineral horizons. The results highlight the need to include the mineral soil in order to gain a more accurate representation of the ectomycorrhizal community.},

  abstract = {The composition of the active microbial (bacterial and fungal) soil community in an arable wheat field subjected to different management practices was examined at five times during a 1-year period. Field sections were fertilized either at good agricultural practice (GAP) levels or at reduced levels (0.5× GAP) and were inoculated with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) at the same time. Field subsections were treated either with or without pesticides. Changes in the active microbial communities were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of reverse transcription-PCR-amplified 16S and 18S rRNA. Microbial community structure was primarily determined by season, and the seasonal trends were similar for the fungal and bacterial components. Between-sample microbial heterogeneity decreased under a mature crop in the summer but increased following harvesting and plowing. Although similar overall trends were seen for the two microbial components, sample variability was greater for the fungal community than for the bacterial community. The greatest management effects were due to GAP fertilization, which caused increases in the bacterial numbers in the total and culturable communities. Microbial biomass similarly increased. GAP fertilization also caused large shifts in both the active bacterial community structure and the active fungal community structure and additionally resulted in a decrease in the heterogeneity of the active bacterial community. Pesticide addition did not significantly affect bacterial numbers or heterogeneity, but it led to major shifts in the active soil bacterial community structure. PCR primers specific for Glomales 25S rRNA genes were used to monitor the VAM population following inoculation. Glomales were detected initially only in VAM-inoculated field sections but were subsequently detected in noninoculated field sections as the season progressed. After plowing, the level of Glomales was reduced in noninoculated field sections but remained high in VAM-inoculated field sections. Inoculation of VAM correlated with elevated soil phosphate and carbon levels.},

  abstract = {The composition of predominant soil bacteria during grassland succession was investigated in the Dutch Drentse A area. Five meadows, taken out of agricultural production at different time points, and one currently fertilized plot represented different stages of grassland succession. Since fertilization and agricultural production were stopped, the six plots showed a constant decline in the levels of nutrients and vegetation changes. The activity of the predominant bacteria was monitored by direct ribosome isolation from soil and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR products generated from bacterial 16S rRNA. The amounts of 16S rRNA of 20 predominant ribosome types per gram of soil were monitored via multiple competitive RT-PCR in six plots at different succession stages. These ribosome types mainly represented Bacillusand members of the Acidobacterium cluster and the α subclass of the class Proteobacteria. The 20 16S rRNA molecules monitored represented approximately half of all bacterial soil rRNA which was estimated by dot blot hybridizations of soil rRNA with the Bacteria probe EUB338. The grasslands showed highly reproducible and specific shifts of bacterial ribosome type composition. The total bacterial ribosome level increased during the first years after agricultural production and fertilization stopped. This correlated with the collapse of the dominant Lolium perenne population and an increased rate of mineralization of organic matter. The results indicate that there is a true correlation between the total activity of the bacterial community in soil and the amount of bacterial ribosomes.},

  abstract = {A simple method that combines an adapted ribosome isolation method and a common RNA extraction step has been developed for selective recovery of intact rRNA from natural microbial communities in soil. After mechanical cell lysis, ribosomes are separated by centrifugation steps, avoiding massive humic acid contamination and RNA degradation. The protocol accommodates the complex composition of soils by blocking adsorbing surfaces and humic acids with polyvinylpyrrolidone and bovine serum albumin. A usual RNA extraction step yields rRNA accessible for hybridization or reverse transcription-PCR. Hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes was used for group-specific yield comparison. By using a probe hybridizing to the 16S rRNA of the bacterial kingdom, total bacterial rRNA yield was estimated to be in the range of 0.2 microgram per g for different soils. Group-specific probes did not indicate a selectivity of the isolation procedure and differentiated the compositions of different soil microbial communities. The sequence diversity of the isolated RNA population was also revealed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis of reverse transcription-PCR amplification products by using a region of the 16S rRNA as a target. The pattern obtained by this analysis differed from a similar one resulting from the separation of amplification products of community DNA preparations. This different view of the community composition is attributable to the correlation of ribosome numbers to the metabolic activity of bacteria in the habitat under observation.},

  abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

Research now shows that dominance is not the result of one trait or mechanism. We suggest that the striking dominance of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Congo is the result of a number of traits in adult trees that significantly modify the understory environment, making it difficult for other species to regenerate there. Adults cast deep shade that reduces light levels in the understory of the Gilbertiodendron forest to levels significantly lower than in the mixed‐species forest. Moreover, the monodominant forest has deep leaf litter that could inhibit the establishment of small‐seeded species, and the leaf litter is slow to decompose, potentially causing the low availability of nitrogen. We expect that juveniles of Gilbertiodendron may have an advantage in this environment over other species. In general, it appears that all tropical monodominant species share a similar suite of traits.},

This study was aimed to examine the effects of fire on macrofungal taxa richness, diversity and sporocarp production in the Dry Afromontane forests in Ethiopia. Sporocarps were collected from nine plots (100m2) established in one- and ten-year-old burned stands, and in an unburned stands. The data were used to quantify fungal richness and sporocarp fresh weights. Morphological and molecular analyses were used to identify the fungi. Composite soil samples were also collected from each stand and used to determine main edaphic explanatory variables for taxa composition. A total of 61 fungal taxa, belonging to Basidiomycota division were reported, of which 22 were edible. Fungal diversity, richness and sporocarp production were affected just after the fire. Fungal community composition was significantly correlated with Organic matter, P and Ca. Generally, the result is encouraging from the point of view of fungal conservation. It provides novelty information about the macrofungal communities in Ethiopian dry Afromontane forests, likely including many taxa are still unknown to science as well as several edible species which could supply complementary incomes for the rural populations in the study area.},

  abstract = {Post-fire Pezizales fruit commonly in many forest types after fire. The objectives of this study were to determine which Pezizales appeared as sporocarps after a prescribed fire in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, and whether species of Pezizales formed mycorrhizas on ponderosa pine, whether or not they were detected from sporocarps. Forty-two sporocarp collections in five genera (Anthracobia, Morchella, Peziza, Scutellinia, Tricharina) of post-fire Pezizales produced ten restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types. We found no root tips colonized by species of post-fire Pezizales fruiting at our site. However, 15\% (6/39) of the RFLP types obtained from mycorrhizal roots within 32 soil cores were ascomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses of the 18S nuclear ribosomal DNA gene indicated that four of the six RFLP types clustered with two genera of the Pezizales, Wilcoxina and Geopora. Subsequent analyses indicated that two of these mycobionts were probably Wilcoxina rehmii, one Geopora cooperi, and one Geopora sp. The identities of two types were not successfully determined with PCR-based methods. Results contribute knowledge about the above- and below-ground ascomycete community in a ponderosa pine forest after a low intensity fire.},

  abstract = {This study examined the short-term effects of wildfire on fungal communities in two Mediterranean ecosystems in northwestern Spain, dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. and Cistus ladanifer L., respectively. A large wildfire burned the areas on August 2002. During the autumn of 2003, fruiting bodies found in the plots were identified, and mycological richness, diversity and production in both burned and unburned areas were measured. A 50m×2m transect was established in each plot. In P. pinaster plots, total fungal dry weight decreased from 35.3kgha−1 in unburned plots to 1.9kgha−1 in burned plots, where richness, diversity of mycorrhizal species and production of edible fungi were significantly lower. Dry weight for mycorrhizal species was higher than for saprophytic fungi in the unburned treatments (75\% and 25\% of the total, respectively), but it was not significantly different in burned areas (56\% and 44\%). In C. ladanifer plots, mycorrhizal species diversity was higher than that for saprophytic species. However, diversity of total, mycorrhizal and saprophytic fungal species was significantly lower in burned plots. An overall decrease of richness was also observed in these plots. Fire significantly increased the abundance of the pyrophytic mycorrhizal species Leccinum corsicum, whereas Boletus edulis, usually associated with C. ladanifer in northwestern Spain, was not found in burned plots. Some mycorrhizal fungi associated with C. ladanifer are common to Pinus forests, so these pyrophytic shrubs can play an important role in the regeneration of P. pinaster stands after wildfire.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with some of the larger, more or less yellowish or orange Cantharellus species from the tropical African woodlands and rain forests. Four new species with clamp connections are described: Cantharellus guineensis, C. mikemboensis, C. pseudomiomboensis and C. stramineus. The new taxa show moderate to strong resemblance to either Cantharellus rufopunctatus or C. miomboensis. A two-locus phylogeny, based on part of the protein coding genes rpb2 and tef-1, resolved them as a highly supported clade within Cantharellus subgenus Rubrinus, a subgenus still exclusively composed of tropical African species. This monophyletic clade is here described as a new section within subg. Rubrinus. As the subgenus was previously defined as being composed of chanterelles lacking clamp connections, the definition of the subgenus is here amended. Illustrations and new records are also presented for Cantharellus afrocibarius, C. defibulatus, C. miomboensis, C. rufopunctatus and C. sublaevis. This paper provides first sequences for C. defibulatus, C. rufopunctatus and C. sublaevis, all of which are here epitypified, as well as new sequences for more than a dozen other Cantharellus. Cantharellus cibarius var. latifolius is considered a synonym of C. afrocibarius. An identification key to all mainland African Cantharellus is proposed.},

Both new species are, however, genetically clearly divergent. Such a scenario of “cryptic species” corresponds to a concept that is widely admitted even by field mycologists and therefore easily accepted. In contrast, typical forms of the here newly described C. velutinus sp. nov. are nearly indistinguishable from C. lateritius, but the phenotypic variability of this new species (as supported by phylogenetic inference of the TEF-1 gene) is so impressive that it is hard to accept that the various observed phenotypic forms all belong to a single species as indeed suggested by their identical sequence data. The latter scenario, that of lumping easily separable phenotypic forms in the field under a single species epitheton encounters much more criticism from most field mycologists and is only reluctantly accepted.},

  abstract = {In the Pacific Northwest, yellow chanterelles have long been referred to as Cantharellus cibarius, synonymous with the European yellow chanterelle. Broad scale genetic surveys of North American chanterelles with C. cibarius-like morphology have demonstrated that the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer exhibits length variability, suggesting that this common morphology masks a species complex. Recently researchers have used morphological and genetic data to identify the yellow chanterelle most frequently harvested from American Pacific Northwest forests as C. formosus, a species once thought to be rare in the region. We present three genetic data sets and one morphological data set that characterize a previously undescribed, species of yellow chanterelle from the central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Phylogenetic analyses of the nrDNA large subunit and ITS regions show that C. cascadensis sp. nov., along with two other yellow chanterelle taxa (C. cibarius var. roseocanus and European C. cibarius), are more closely related to white chanterelles (C. subalbidus) than they are to C. formosus. Data from five microsatellite loci provide evidence that C. formosus, C. subalbidus, and C. cascadensis sp. nov. do not interbreed when they co-occur spatially and temporally in Douglas fir-western hemlock forests. This demonstrates that these three sympatric chanterelles are biological species with boundaries congruent with those delineated by nrDNA phylogenetic clades. Morphological data indicate that the colour of the pileus and shape of the stipe can be used to separate fresh collections of the two yellow species now known to co-occur in Douglas fir-western hemlock forests in Oregon.},

The World Wide Web Instructional Committee at North Dakota State University has used these research results as an inspiration to develop a suite of high-quality animations of molecular and cellular processes. Currently, these animations represent transcription, translation, bacterial gene expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, mRNA splicing, protein transport into an organelle, the electron transport chain, and the use of a biological gradient to drive adenosine triphosphate synthesis. These animations are integrated with an educational module that consists of First Look and Advanced Look components that feature captioned stills from the animation representing the key steps in the processes at varying levels of complexity. These animation-based educational modules are available via the World Wide Web at http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations. An in-class research experiment demonstrated that student retention of content material was significantly better when students received a lecture coupled with the animations and then used the animation as an individual study activity.},

Learning goals were defined based on concepts taught throughout the cell biology lab course and learning objectives specific to the PCR and gel electrophoresis lab. Exercises developed to promote critical thinking and target the underlying concepts of PCR, primer design, gel analysis, and troubleshooting were incorporated into an existing lab unit based on the detection of genetically modified organisms. Evaluative assessments for each exercise were aligned with the learning goals and used to measure student learning achievements. Our analysis found that the exercises were effective in enhancing student understanding of these concepts as shown by student performance across all learning goals. The new materials were particularly helpful in acquiring relevant knowledge, fostering critical-thinking skills, and uncovering prevalent misconceptions.},

The two main bases for estimating total fungal diversity are (1) the number of described species and their taxonomic structure, and (2) extrapolating species-area relationships. We argue that knowledge of fungal taxonomy and environmental sampling of fungi are both too incomplete for either approach to be reliable. However, it is likely that the true number of fungal species on the planet is a seven-digit number, and may even be an order of magnitude higher.},

Current estimates of global species richness are highly uncertain, and the importance of stochastic vs. deterministic forces in the assembly of fungal communities is unknown. Molecular studies have so far failed to reach saturated, comprehensive estimates of fungal diversity. To obtain a more accurate estimate of global fungal diversity, we used a direct molecular approach to census diversity in a boreal ecosystem with precisely known plant diversity, and we carefully evaluated adequacy of sampling and accuracy of species delineation. We achieved the first exhaustive enumeration of fungi in soil, recording 1002 taxa in this system. We show that the fungus : plant ratio in Picea mariana forest soils from interior Alaska is at least 17:1 and is regionally stable. A global extrapolation of this ratio would suggest 6 million species of fungi, as opposed to leading estimates ranging from 616 000 to 1.5 million. We also find that closely related fungi often occupy divergent niches. This pattern is seen in fungi spanning all major functional guilds and four phyla, suggesting a major role of deterministic niche partitioning in community assembly. Extinctions and range shifts are reorganizing biodiversity on Earth, yet our results suggest that 98\% of fungi remain undescribed and that many of these species occupy unique niches.},

  abstract = {The diversity, ecology and function of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi and ectomycorrhizas (ECMs) on tropical African tree species are reviewed here. While ECMs are the most frequent mycorrhizal type in temperate and boreal forests, they concern an economically and ecologically important minority of plants in African tropical forests. In these African tropical forests, ECMs are found mainly on caesalpionioid legumes, Sarcolaenaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Asterpeiaceae, Phyllantaceae, Sapotaceae, Papilionoideae, Gnetaceae and Proteaceae, and distributed in open, gallery and rainforests of the Guineo-Congolian basin, Zambezian Miombo woodlands of East and South-Central Africa and Sudanian savannah woodlands of the sub-sahara. Overall, EM status was confirmed in 93 (26\%) among 354 tree species belonging to EM genera. In addition, 195 fungal taxa were identified using morphological descriptions and sequencing of the ML5/ML6 fragment of sporocarps and ECMs from West Africa. Analyses of the belowground EM fungal communities mostly based on fungal internal transcribed spacer sequences of ECMs from Continental Africa, Madagascar and the Seychelles also revealed more than 350 putative species of EM fungi belonging mainly to 18 phylogenetic lineages. As in temperate forests, the /russula–lactarius and /tomentella–thelephora lineages dominated EM fungal flora in tropical Africa. A low level of host preference and dominance of multi-host fungal taxa on different African adult tree species and their seedlings were revealed, suggesting a potential for the formation of common ectomycorrhizal networks. Moreover, the EM inoculum potential in terms of types and density of propagules (spores, sclerotia, EM root fragments and fragments of mycelia strands) in the soil allowed opportunistic root colonisation as well as long-term survival in the soil during the dry season. These are important characteristics when choosing an EM fungus for field application. In this respect, Thelephoroid fungal sp. XM002, an efficient and competitive broad host range EM fungus, possessed these characteristics and appeared to be a good candidate for artificial inoculation of Caesalps and Phyllanthaceae seedlings in nurseries. However, further efforts should be made to assess the genetic and functional diversity of African EM fungi as well as the EM status of unstudied plant species and to strengthen the use of efficient and competitive EM fungi to improve production of ecologically and economically important African multipurpose trees in plantations.},

Eucalyptus robusta shared five of these taxa, whereas P. caribea hosted three unique species of ECM fungi that were likely cointroduced with containerized seedlings. The thelephoroid (including the anamorphic genus Riessiella), euagaric, boletoid and hymenochaetoid clades of basidiomycetes dominated the ECM fungal community of native trees. Two species of Annulatascaceae (Sordariales, Ascomycota) were identified and described as ECM symbionts of V. seychellarum. • The low diversity of native ECM fungi is attributed to deforestation and long-term isolation of the Seychelles.

DNA fragments up to 2 kilobase pairs in length were efficiently amplified from crude DNA samples of several pathogenic Cryptococcus species, including C. neoformans, C. albidus, C. laurentii, and C. uniguttulatus. Digestion and electrophoresis of the PCR products by using frequent-cutting restriction enzymes produced complex restriction phenotypes (fingerprints) that were often unique for each strain or species. We used the PCR to amplify and analyze restriction pattern variation within three major portions of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats from these fungi. Detailed mapping of many restriction sites within the rDNA locus was determined by fingerprint analysis of progressively larger PCR fragments sharing a common primer site at one end. As judged by PCR fingerprints, the rDNA of 19 C. neoformans isolates showed no variation for four restriction enzymes that we surveyed. Other Cryptococcus spp. showed varying levels of restriction pattern variation within their rDNAs and were shown to be genetically distinct from C. neoformans. The PCR primers used in this study have also been successfully applied for amplification of rDNAs from other pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi, including Candida spp., and ought to have wide applicability for clinical detection and other studies.},

This study represents the first effort to combine variable regions of RPB1 and RPB2 with nLSU-rDNA for low-level phylogenetic studies in mushroom-forming fungi. Combination of the three loci increases non-parametric bootstrap support, Bayesian posterior probabilities, and resolution for numerous clades compared to separate gene analyses. These data suggest the evolution of at least five major lineages in Inocybe—the Inocybe clade, the Mallocybe clade, the Auritella clade, the Inosperma clade, and the Pseudosperma clade. Additionally, many clades nested within each major lineage are strongly supported. These results also suggest the family Crepiodataceae sensu stricto is sister to Inocybe. Recognition of Inocybe at the family level, the Inocybaceae, is recommended.},

  abstract = {Bacteria comprise the most diverse domain of life on Earth, where they occupy nearly every possible ecological niche and play key roles in biological and chemical processes. Studying the composition and ecology of bacterial ecosystems and understanding their function are of prime importance. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable nearly comprehensive descriptions of bacterial diversity through 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. Analyses of these communities generally rely upon taxonomic assignments through reference data bases or clustering approaches using de facto sequence similarity thresholds to identify operational taxonomic units. However, these methods often fail to resolve ecologically meaningful differences between closely related organisms in complex microbial data sets. In this paper, we describe oligotyping, a novel supervised computational method that allows researchers to investigate the diversity of closely related but distinct bacterial organisms in final operational taxonomic units identified in environmental data sets through 16S ribosomal RNA gene data by the canonical approaches. Our analysis of two data sets from two different environments demonstrates the capacity of oligotyping at discriminating distinct microbial populations of ecological importance. Oligotyping can resolve the distribution of closely related organisms across environments and unveil previously overlooked ecological patterns for microbial communities.

We present a clustering-free approach to multi-sample Illumina data sets that can identify independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16S tag sequences. Using published data from a longitudinal time-series study of human tongue microbiota, we are able to resolve within standard 97\% similarity OTUs up to 20 distinct subpopulations, all ecologically distinct but with 16S tags differing by as little as one nucleotide (99.2\% similarity). A comparative analysis of oral communities of two cohabiting individuals reveals that most such subpopulations are shared between the two communities at 100\% sequence identity, and that dynamical similarity between subpopulations in one host is strongly predictive of dynamical similarity between the same subpopulations in the other host. Our method can also be applied to samples collected in cross-sectional studies and can be used with the 454 sequencing platform. We discuss how the sub-OTU resolution of our approach can provide new insight into factors shaping community assembly.},

  abstract = {Molecular microbial ecology investigations often employ large marker gene datasets, for example, ribosomal RNAs, to represent the occurrence of single-cell genomes in microbial communities. Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies enable extensive surveys of marker gene libraries that sometimes include nearly identical sequences. Computational approaches that rely on pairwise sequence alignments for similarity assessment and de novo clustering with de facto similarity thresholds to partition high-throughput sequencing datasets constrain fine-scale resolution descriptions of microbial communities. Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) provides a computationally efficient means to partition marker gene datasets into ‘MED nodes’, which represent homogeneous operational taxonomic units. By employing Shannon entropy, MED uses only the information-rich nucleotide positions across reads and iteratively partitions large datasets while omitting stochastic variation. When applied to analyses of microbiomes from two deep-sea cryptic sponges Hexadella dedritifera and Hexadella cf. dedritifera, MED resolved a key Gammaproteobacteria cluster into multiple MED nodes that are specific to different sponges, and revealed that these closely related sympatric sponge species maintain distinct microbial communities. MED analysis of a previously published human oral microbiome dataset also revealed that taxa separated by less than 1\% sequence variation distributed to distinct niches in the oral cavity. The information theory-guided decomposition process behind the MED algorithm enables sensitive discrimination of closely related organisms in marker gene amplicon datasets without relying on extensive computational heuristics and user supervision.},

New sequencing technologies produce long reads that can span the entire 16S rRNA gene, but have substantially higher error rates that have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution and a near-zero error rate. In two artificial mixtures of known bacterial strains our method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence variants from expected community members, without residual errors. The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants within a genome. E. coli strains in the mock communities were correctly classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades from the 16S gene sequences recovered by our method. In human fecal samples, our method recovered the full complement of 16S rRNA gene variants in detected E. coli strains and showed strong technical replication. We discuss the promises and challenges of of classification based on the full complement of multi-copy marker genes such as the 16S rRNA gene.

New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs—including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction—and of de novo OTUs—including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons has facilitated understanding of complex microbial communities, but the inherent noise in PCR and DNA sequencing limits differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur’s ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from https://github.com/biocore/deblur.
IMPORTANCE Deblur provides a rapid and sensitive means to assess ecological patterns driven by differentiation of closely related taxa. This algorithm provides a solution to the problem of identifying real ecological differences between taxa whose amplicons differ by a single base pair, is applicable in an automated fashion to large-scale sequencing data sets, and can integrate sequencing runs collected over time.},

The relatively short reads produced by next-generation sequencing, however, makes primer choice and sequence error important variables for obtaining accurate taxonomic classifications. In this simulation study we tested the performance of three classification methods: 1) a similarity-based method (BLAST + Metagenomic Analyzer, MEGAN); 2) a composition-based method (Ribosomal Database Project naïve Bayesian classifier, NBC); and, 3) a phylogeny-based method (Statistical Assignment Package, SAP). We also tested the effects of sequence length, primer choice, and sequence error on classification accuracy and perceived community composition. Using a leave-one-out cross validation approach, results for classifications to the genus rank were as follows: BLAST + MEGAN had the lowest error rate and was particularly robust to sequence error; SAP accuracy was highest when long LSU query sequences were classified; and, NBC runs significantly faster than the other tested methods. All methods performed poorly with the shortest 50–100 bp sequences. Increasing simulated sequence error reduced classification accuracy. Community shifts were detected due to sequence error and primer selection even though there was no change in the underlying community composition. Short read datasets from individual primers, as well as pooled datasets, appear to only approximate the true community composition. We hope this work informs investigators of some of the factors that affect the quality and interpretation of their environmental gene surveys.},

  abstract = {Wood-inhabiting fungi are one of the most important groups of organisms as they contribute substantially to carbon and nutrient cycles by decomposing dead wood. Current knowledge of their occurrence, distribution, and drivers of their diversity derives almost exclusively from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. We sampled wood-inhabiting fungi across Benin, a tropical country in West Africa with a strong north–south seasonality gradient consisting of three macroclimatic zones. We aimed at determining whether macroclimate or the resource (size or amount of dead wood, number of host tree species, and stage of wood decomposition) is more important for their diversity. Variation partitioning revealed a stronger partial effect of resource on fungal species richness and a strong effect of macroclimate on the community composition. A more detailed linear mixed-effects model revealed a significantly positive effect of host richness, amount of dead wood, and macroclimate on fungal species richness and a significantly positive effect of macroclimate and stage of wood decomposition on the community composition. These findings are consistent with patterns found in temperate and boreal ecosystems, which indicates the existence of general pattern of the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi. Based on these results, we recommend that existing knowledge should be exploited for the conservation of wood-inhabiting fungi in tropical Africa. Thus, to protect tropical wood-inhabiting fungal diversity, we recommend that any size of dead-wood objects of diverse tree species be enriched in all tropical macroclimatic zones.},

We developed Protax-fungi, a general tool for taxonomic placement of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and implemented it into the PlutoF platform of the UNITE database for molecular identification of fungi. With empirical data on root- and wood-associated fungi, Protax-fungi reliably identified (with at least 90\% identification probability) the majority of sequences to the order level but only around one-fifth of them to the species level, reflecting the current limited coverage of the databases. Protax-fungi outperformed the Sintax and Rdb classifiers in terms of increased accuracy and decreased calibration error when applied to data on mock communities representing species groups with poor sequence database coverage. We applied Protax-fungi to examine the internal consistencies of the Index Fungorum and UNITE databases. This revealed inconsistencies in the taxonomy database as well as mislabelling and sequence quality problems in the reference database. The according improvements were implemented in both databases. Protax-fungi provides a robust tool for performing statistically reliable identifications of fungi in spite of the incompleteness of extant reference sequence databases and unresolved taxonomic relationships.},

To elucidate the mechanism of this type of endosymbiosis, we combined PacBio and Illumina sequencing to assemble a high-quality and near-complete macronuclear genome of P. bursaria. The genomic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses indicate that P. bursaria is the basal clade of the Paramecium genus. Through comparative genomic analyses with its close relatives, we found that P. bursaria encodes more genes related to nitrogen metabolism and mineral absorption, but encodes fewer genes involved in oxygen binding and N-glycan biosynthesis. A comparison of the transcriptomic profiles between P. bursaria with and without endosymbiotic Chlorella showed differential expression of a wide range of metabolic genes. We selected 32 most differentially expressed genes to perform RNA interference experiment in P. bursaria, and found that P. bursaria can regulate the abundance of their symbionts through glutamine supply. This study provides novel insights into Paramecium evolution and will extend our knowledge of the molecular mechanism for the induction of endosymbiosis between P. bursaria and green algae.},

The history of fire disturbances and the season of sampling influenced the composition of myxomycete assemblages. Several species showed substrate preferences different from what is known from fruiting body records. A high abundance of nivicolous species in the majority of the samples suggests that this ecological group constitutes a common element of soil microbial communities in lowland taiga forests. Four species are reported for the Leningrad region for the first time. Our results support the hypothesis that amoebae populations of myxomycetes may have much wider ecological niches than indicated by records of fructifications, and further environmental studies may provide valuable new insights on myxomycete ecology and distribution.},

  abstract = {The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region is the primary choice for molecular identification of fungi. Its two highly variable spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) are usually species specific, whereas the intercalary 5.8S gene is highly conserved. For sequence clustering and blast searches, it is often advantageous to rely on either one of the variable spacers but not the conserved 5.8S gene. To identify and extract ITS1 and ITS2 from large taxonomic and environmental data sets is, however, often difficult, and many ITS sequences are incorrectly delimited in the public sequence databases. We introduce ITSx, a Perl-based software tool to extract ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 – as well as full-length ITS sequences – from both Sanger and high-throughput sequencing data sets. ITSx uses hidden Markov models computed from large alignments of a total of 20 groups of eukaryotes, including fungi, metazoans and plants, and the sequence extraction is based on the predicted positions of the ribosomal genes in the sequences. ITSx has a very high proportion of true-positive extractions and a low proportion of false-positive extractions. Additionally, process parallelization permits expedient analyses of very large data sets, such as a one million sequence amplicon pyrosequencing data set. ITSx is rich in features and written to be easily incorporated into automated sequence analysis pipelines. ITSx paves the way for more sensitive blast searches and sequence clustering operations for the ITS region in eukaryotes. The software also permits elimination of non-ITS sequences from any data set. This is particularly useful for amplicon-based next-generation sequencing data sets, where insidious non-target sequences are often found among the target sequences. Such non-target sequences are difficult to find by other means and would contribute noise to diversity estimates if left in the data set.},

SILVA dates back to the year 1991 when Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig from the Technical University Munich started the integrated software workbench ARB (lat. tree) to support high-quality phylogenetic inference and taxonomy based on the SSU and LSU rDNA marker genes. At that time, the ARB project maintained both, the sequence reference datasets and the software package for data analysis. In 2005, with the massive increase of DNA sequence data, the maintenance of the software system ARB and the corresponding rRNA databases SILVA was split between Munich and the Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Group in Bremen. ARB has been continuously developed to include new features and improve the usability of the workbench. Thousands of users worldwide appreciate the seamless integration of common analysis tools under a central graphical user interface, in combination with its versatility. The first SILVA release was deployed in February 2007 based on the EMBL-EBI/ENA release 89. Since then, full SILVA releases offering the database content in various flavours are published at least annually, complemented by intermediate web-releases where only the SILVA web dataset is updated. SILVA is the only rDNA database project worldwide where special emphasis is given to the consistent naming of clades of uncultivated (environmental) sequences, where no validly described cultivated representatives are available. Also exclusive for SILVA is the maintenance of both comprehensive aligned 16S/18S rDNA and 23S/28S rDNA sequence datasets. Furthermore, the SILVA alignments and trees were designed to include Eukaryota, another unique feature among rDNA databases. With the termination of the European Ribosomal RNA Database Project in 2007, the SILVA database has become the authoritative rDNA database project for Europe. The application spectrum of ARB and SILVA ranges from biodiversity analysis, medical diagnostics, to biotechnology and quality control for academia and industry.},

  abstract = {Background
Sequence alignment is crucial in genomics studies. However, optimal multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is NP-hard. Thus, modern MSA methods employ progressive heuristics, breaking the problem into a series of pairwise alignments guided by a phylogeny. Changes between homologous characters are typically modelled by a Markov substitution model. In contrast, the dynamics of indels are not modelled explicitly, because the computation of the marginal likelihood under such models has exponential time complexity in the number of taxa. But the failure to model indel evolution may lead to artificially short alignments due to biased indel placement, inconsistent with phylogenetic relationship.

Results
Recently, the classical indel model TKF91 was modified to describe indel evolution on a phylogeny via a Poisson process, termed PIP. PIP allows to compute the joint marginal probability of an MSA and a tree in linear time. We present a new dynamic programming algorithm to align two MSAs –represented by the underlying homology paths– by full maximum likelihood under PIP in polynomial time, and apply it progressively along a guide tree. We have corroborated the correctness of our method by simulation, and compared it with competitive methods on an illustrative real dataset.

Conclusions
Our MSA method is the first polynomial time progressive aligner with a rigorous mathematical formulation of indel evolution. The new method infers phylogenetically meaningful gap patterns alternative to the popular PRANK, while producing alignments of similar length. Moreover, the inferred gap patterns agree with what was predicted qualitatively by previous studies. The algorithm is implemented in a standalone C++ program: https://github.com/acg-team/ProPIP.

The sample-size- and coverage-based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation) and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity across multiple assemblages. We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and sampling-unit-based incidence data. Several applications of the iNEXT packages are reviewed: (i) Non-asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii) Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples. (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size or a specified level of sample coverage. Two examples are demonstrated, using the data (one for abundance data and the other for incidence data) included in the package, to illustrate all R functions and graphical displays.},

While some methods have been developed to estimate alignments under these stochastic models, only the Bayesian method BAli-Phy has been able to run on even moderately large datasets, containing 100 or so sequences.

  abstract = {Protecting biological diversity with limited resources may require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.},

We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas.

  shorttitle = {{{IDTAXA}}},
  abstract = {Microbiome studies often involve sequencing a marker gene to identify the microorganisms in samples of interest. Sequence classification is a critical component of this process, whereby sequences are assigned to a reference taxonomy containing known sequence representatives of many microbial groups. Previous studies have shown that existing classification programs often assign sequences to reference groups even if they belong to novel taxonomic groups that are absent from the reference taxonomy. This high rate of “over classification” is particularly detrimental in microbiome studies because reference taxonomies are far from comprehensive. Here, we introduce IDTAXA, a novel approach to taxonomic classification that employs principles from machine learning to reduce over classification errors. Using multiple reference taxonomies, we demonstrate that IDTAXA has higher accuracy than popular classifiers such as BLAST, MAPSeq, QIIME, SINTAX, SPINGO, and the RDP Classifier. Similarly, IDTAXA yields far fewer over classifications on Illumina mock microbial community data when the expected taxa are absent from the training set. Furthermore, IDTAXA offers many practical advantages over other classifiers, such as maintaining low error rates across varying input sequence lengths and withholding classifications from input sequences composed of random nucleotides or repeats. IDTAXA’s classifications may lead to different conclusions in microbiome studies because of the substantially reduced number of taxa that are incorrectly identified through over classification. Although misclassification error is relatively minor, we believe that many remaining misclassifications are likely caused by errors in the reference taxonomy. We describe how IDTAXA is able to identify many putative mislabeling errors in reference taxonomies, enabling training sets to be automatically corrected by eliminating spurious sequences. IDTAXA is part of the DECIPHER package for the R programming language, available through the Bioconductor repository or accessible online ( http://DECIPHER.codes ).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative analysis of RNA sequences is the basis for the detailed and accurate predictions of RNA structure and the determination of phylogenetic relationships for organisms that span the entire phylogenetic tree. Underlying these accomplishments are very large, well-organized, and processed collections of RNA sequences. This data, starting with the sequences organized into a database management system and aligned to reveal their higher-order structure, and patterns of conservation and variation for organisms that span the phylogenetic tree, has been collected and analyzed. This type of information can be fundamental for and have an influence on the study of phylogenetic relationships, RNA structure, and the melding of these two fields.
RESULTS: We have prepared a large web site that disseminates our comparative sequence and structure models and data. The four major types of comparative information and systems available for the three ribosomal RNAs (5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and two of the catalytic intron RNAs (group I and group II) are: (1) Current Comparative Structure Models; (2) Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information; (3) Sequence and Structure Data; and (4) Data Access Systems.
CONCLUSIONS: This online RNA sequence and structure information, the result of extensive analysis, interpretation, data collection, and computer program and web development, is accessible at our Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu. In the future, more data and information will be added to these existing categories, new categories will be developed, and additional RNAs will be studied and presented at the CRW Site.},

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence (≥95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.},

  abstract = {Lichens assemble in three parts
Lichen growth forms cannot be recapitulated in the laboratory by culturing the plant and fungal partners together. Spribille et al. have discovered that the classical binary view of lichens is too simple. Instead, North American beard-like lichens are constituted of not two but three symbiotic partners: an ascomycetous fungus, a photosynthetic alga, and, unexpectedly, a basidiomycetous yeast. The yeast cells form the characteristic cortex of the lichen thallus and may be important for its shape. The yeasts are ubiquitous and essential partners for most lichens and not the result of lichens being colonized or parasitized by other organisms.
Science, this issue p. 488
For over 140 years, lichens have been regarded as a symbiosis between a single fungus, usually an ascomycete, and a photosynthesizing partner. Other fungi have long been known to occur as occasional parasites or endophytes, but the one lichen–one fungus paradigm has seldom been questioned. Here we show that many common lichens are composed of the known ascomycete, the photosynthesizing partner, and, unexpectedly, specific basidiomycete yeasts. These yeasts are embedded in the cortex, and their abundance correlates with previously unexplained variations in phenotype. Basidiomycete lineages maintain close associations with specific lichen species over large geographical distances and have been found on six continents. The structurally important lichen cortex, long treated as a zone of differentiated ascomycete cells, appears to consistently contain two unrelated fungi.
Complete functioning lichen thalli have three partners: alga and ascomycete, plus a basidiomycete yeast.

  abstract = {I explore the use of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), an extension of partial Mantel analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence–absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding of vertebrate DNA derived from carrion flies has been proposed as a promising tool for biodiversity monitoring. To evaluate its efficacy, we conducted metabarcoding surveys of carrion flies on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, which has a well-known mammal community, and compared our results against diurnal transect counts and camera-trapping. We collected 1084 flies in 29 sampling days, conducted metabarcoding with mammal-specific (16S) and vertebrate-specific (12S) primers, and sequenced amplicons on Illumina MiSeq. For taxonomic assignment, we compared BLAST with the new program PROTAX, and we found that PROTAX improved species identifications. We detected 20 mammal, four bird, and one lizard species from carrion fly metabarcoding, all but one of which are known from BCI. Fly metabarcoding detected more mammal species than concurrent transect counts (29 sampling days, 13 species) and concurrent camera-trapping (84 sampling days, 17 species), and detected 67\% of the number of mammal species documented by eight years of transect counts and camera-trapping combined, although fly metabarcoding missed several abundant species. This study demonstrates that carrion fly metabarcoding is a powerful tool for mammal biodiversity surveys, and has the potential to detect a broader range of species than more commonly used methods.},

I assessed the accuracy of several algorithms using cross-validation by identity, a new benchmark strategy which explicitly models the variation in distances between query sequences and the closest entry in a reference database. When the accuracy of genus predictions was averaged over a representative range of identities with the reference database (100\%, 99\%, 97\%, 95\% and 90\%), all tested methods had ≤50\% accuracy on the currently-popular V4 region of 16S rRNA. Accuracy was found to fall rapidly with identity; for example, better methods were found to have V4 genus prediction accuracy of ∼100\% at 100\% identity but ∼50\% at 97\% identity. The relationship between identity and taxonomy was quantified as the probability that a rank is the lowest shared by a pair of sequences with a given pair-wise identity. With the V4 region, 95\% identity was found to be a twilight zone where taxonomy is highly ambiguous because the probabilities that the lowest shared rank between pairs of sequences is genus, family, order or class are approximately equal.},

The branching orders of the Greengenes and SILVA guide trees were found to disagree at comparable rates with each other and with taxonomy annotations according to the training set (authoritative reference) provided by RDP, indicating that the trees have comparable quality.

Strong palaeoecological and genetic evidence supports a postglacial recolonization of most plant species to northern Europe from southern, eastern and even western glacial refugia. Although highly controversial, the existence of small in situ glacial refugia in northern Europe has recently gained molecular support. We used genomic analyses to examine the phylogeography of a species that is critical in this debate. Carex scirpoidea Michx subsp. scirpoidea is a dioecious, amphi-Atlantic arctic–alpine sedge that is widely distributed in North America, but absent from most of Eurasia, apart from three extremely disjunct populations in Norway, all well within the limits of the Weichselian ice sheet. Range-wide population sampling and variation at 5,307 single nucleotide polymorphisms show that the three Norwegian populations comprise unique evolutionary lineages divergent from Greenland with high between-population divergence. The Norwegian populations have low within-population genetic diversity consistent with having experienced genetic bottlenecks in glacial refugia, and host private alleles that probably accumulated in long-term isolated populations. Demographic analyses support a single, pre-Weichselian colonization into Norway from East Greenland, and subsequent divergence of the three populations in separate refugia. Other refugial areas are identified in North-east Greenland, Minnesota/Michigan, Colorado and Alaska. Admixed populations in British Columbia and West Greenland indicate postglacial contact. Taken together, evidence from this study strongly indicates in situ glacial survival in Scandinavia.},

  abstract = {Ribosomal RNAs are the most abundant and universal noncoding RNAs in living organisms. In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs forming the 40S and 60S subunits are borne by a long polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA. A complex sequence of processing steps is required to gradually release the mature RNAs from this precursor, concomitant with the assembly of the 79 ribosomal proteins. A large set of trans-acting factors chaperone this process, including small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles. While yeast has been the gold standard for studying the molecular basis of this process, recent technical advances have allowed to further define the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in animals and plants. This renewed interest for a long-lasting question has been fueled by the association of several genetic diseases with mutations in genes encoding both ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, and by the perspective of new anticancer treatments targeting the mechanisms of ribosome synthesis. A consensus scheme of pre-ribosomal RNA maturation is emerging from studies in various kinds of eukaryotic organisms. However, major differences between mammalian and yeast pre-ribosomal RNA processing have recently come to light.

However, in most cases just one secondary structure is used in manually correcting an automatically generated multiple sequence alignment and/or just one secondary structure is used in guiding a sequence alignment still completely generated by hand. With the advent of databases and tools offering individual RNA secondary structures, here we re-introduce a twelve letter code already implemented in 4SALE – a tool for synchronous sequence and secondary structure alignment and editing – that enables one to align RNA sequences and their individual secondary structures synchronously and fully automatic, while dramatically increasing the phylogenetic information content. We further introduce a scaled down non-GUI version of 4SALE particularly designed for big data analysis, and available at: http://4sale.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de.},

The currently used approaches to RNA modeling are presented with a side view on the protein world, where many similar ideas have been used. Two main programs for automated template-based modeling are presented: ModeRNA assembling structures from fragments and MacroMoleculeBuilder performing a simulation to satisfy spatial restraints. Both approaches have in common that they require an alignment of the target sequence to a known RNA structure that is used as a modeling template. As a way to find promising template structures and to align the target and template sequences, we propose a pipeline combining the ParAlign and Infernal programs on RNA family data from Rfam. We also briefly summarize template-free methods for RNA 3D structure prediction. Typically, RNA structures generated by automated modeling methods require local or global optimization. Thus, we also discuss methods that can be used for local or global refinement of RNA structures.},

Recognition of ncRNA targets is predominantly governed by two principles, namely the stability of the duplex between the two interacting RNAs and the internal structure of both mRNA and ncRNA. Thus, approaches can be distinguished into different major categories depending on how they consider inter- and intramolecular structure. The first class completely neglects the internal structure and measures only the stability of the duplex. The second class of approaches abstracts from specific intramolecular structures and uses an ensemble-based approach to calculate the effect of internal structure on a putative binding site, thus measuring the accessibility of the binding sites.Since accessibility-based approaches can handle only one continuous interaction site, two addition types of approaches were introduced which predict a joint structure for the interacting RNAs. Since this problem is NP-complete, the approaches can handle only a restricted class of joint structures. The first are co-folding approaches, which predict a joint structure that is nested when the both sequences are concatenated. The last and most complex class of approaches impose only the restriction that they discard zipper-like structures. Finally, we will discuss the use of conservation information in RNA-target prediction.},

Massive amounts of data describing unknown functional RNA transcripts have to be analyzed for putative miRNA candidates with automated computational pipelines. Beyond those miRNAs that meet the classical definition, high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed additional miRNA-like molecules that are derived by alternative biogenesis pathways. Exhaustive bioinformatics analyses on such data involve statistical issues as well as precise sequence and structure inspection not only of the functional mature part but also of the whole precursor sequence of the putative miRNA. Apart from a considerable amount of species-specific miRNAs, the majority of all those genes are conserved at least among closely related organisms. Some miRNAs, however, can be traced back to very early points in the evolution of eukaryotic species. Thus, the investigation of the conservation of newly found miRNA candidates comprises an important step in the computational annotation of miRNAs.Topics covered in this chapter include a review on the obvious problem of miRNA annotation and family definition, recommended pipelines of computational miRNA annotation or detection, and an overview of current computer tools for the prediction of miRNAs and their limitations. The chapter closes discussing how those bioinformatic approaches address the problem of faithful miRNA prediction and correct annotation.},

As an alternative to target prediction based on sequence alone, comparative genomics has emerged as an invaluable tool for identifying miRNA targets that are conserved by natural selection, and hence likely effective and important. Here we present a general method for quantifying conservation of miRNA seed match sites, separating it from background conservation, controlling for various biases, and predicting miRNA targets. This method is useful not only for generating predictions but also as a tool for empirically evaluating the importance of various target prediction criteria.},

  abstract = {Many different types of functional non-coding RNAs participate in a wide range of important cellular functions but the large majority of these RNAs are not routinely annotated in published genomes. Several programs have been developed for identifying RNAs, including specific tools tailored to a particular RNA family as well as more general ones designed to work for any family. Many of these tools utilize covariance models (CMs), statistical models of the conserved sequence, and structure of an RNA family. In this chapter, as an illustrative example, the Infernal software package and CMs from the Rfam database are used to identify RNAs in the genome of the archaeon Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, uncovering some additional RNAs not present in the genome’s initial annotation. Analysis of the results and comparison with family-specific methods demonstrate some important strengths and weaknesses of this general approach.},

The Sankoff algorithm simultaneously folds and aligns two or more sequences. The advantage of this algorithm over those that separate the folding and alignment steps is that it makes better predictions. The disadvantage is that it is slower and requires more computer memory to run. The amount of computational resources needed to run the Sankoff algorithm is so high that it took more than a decade before the first implementation of a Sankoff style algorithm was published. However, with the faster computers available today and the improved heuristics used in the implementations the Sankoff-based methods have become practical. This chapter describes the methods based on the Sankoff algorithm. All the practical implementations of the algorithm use heuristics to make them run in reasonable time and memory. These heuristics are also described in this chapter.},

In addition, we discuss recently proposed alternatives to the MFE criterion such as the use of maximum expected accuracy (MEA) or centroid structures. The dynamic programming algorithms implicitly assume that the RNA molecule is in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, especially for long RNAs, this need not be the case. In the last section we therefore discuss approaches for predicting RNA folding kinetics and co-transcriptional folding.},

In this chapter, we introduce the methods that predict the structures and the alignment separately to avoid the heavy computations in Sankoff algorithm. In those methods, neither of those two prediction processes is independent, but each of them utilizes the information of the other process. The first process typically includes prediction of base-pairing probabilities (BPPs) or the candidates of the stems, and the alignment process utilizes those results. At the same time, it is also important to reflect the information of the alignment to the structure prediction. This idea can be implemented as the probabilistic transformation (PCT) of BPPs using the potential alignment. As same as for all the estimation problems, it is important to define the evaluation measure for the structural alignment. The principle of maximum expected accuracy (MEA) is applicable for sum-of-pairs (SPS) score based on the reference alignment.},

Limitations of the phylogenetic tree concept were recognized as more and more sequence information became available. The other path-breaking idea of Darwin, natural selection of fitter variants in populations, is cast into simple mathematical form and extended to mutation-selection dynamics. In this form the theory is directly applicable to RNA evolution in vitro and to virus evolution. Phylogeny and population dynamics of RNA provide complementary insights into evolution and the interplay between the two concepts will be pursued throughout this chapter. The two strategies for understanding evolution are ultimately related through the central paradigm of structural biology: sequence ⇒ structure ⇒ function. We elaborate on the state of the art in modeling both phylogeny and evolution of RNA driven by reproduction and mutation. Thereby the focus will be laid on models for phylogenetic sequence evolution as well as evolution and design of RNA structures with selected examples and notes on simulation methods. In the perspectives an attempt is made to combine molecular structure, population dynamics, and phylogeny in modeling evolution.},

  abstract = {Acquisition of mutualistic symbiosis could provide hosts and/or symbionts with novel ecological opportunities for evolutionary diversification. Such a mechanism is one of the major components of coevolutionary diversification. However, whether the origin of mycorrhizal symbiosis promotes diversification in fungi still requires clarification. Here, we aimed to reveal evolutionary diversification in a clade comprising ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Based on a phylogenic tree inferred from the sequences of 87 single-copy genes, we reconstructed the origins of ECM symbiosis in a species-rich basidiomycetous order, Boletales. High-resolution phylogeny of Boletales revealed that ECM symbiosis independently evolved from non-ECM states at least four times in the group. Among them, only the second most recent event, occurring in the clade of Boletaceae, was inferred to involve an almost synchronous rapid diversification and rapid transition from non-ECM to ECM symbiosis. Our results contradict the hypothesis of evolutionary priority effect, which postulates the greatest ecological opportunities in the oldest lineages. Therefore, the novel resources that had not been pre-empted by the old ECM fungal lineages – supposedly the coevolving angiosperm hosts – could be available for the young ECM fungal lineages, which resulted in evolutionary diversification occurring only in the young ECM fungal lineages.},

Its highly variable nature predisposes the ITS1 for low level phylogenetics; however, it complicates the establishment of reproducible alignments and the reconstruction of stable phylogenetic trees at higher taxonomic levels (genus and above). Here, we overcame these problems by proposing a common core secondary structure of the ITS1 of the anaerobic fungi employing a Hidden Markov Model-based ITS1 sequence annotation and a helix-wise folding approach. We integrated the additional structural information into phylogenetic analyses and present for the first time an automated sequence-structure-based taxonomy of the ITS1 of the anaerobic fungi. The methodology developed is transferable to the ITS1 of other fungal groups, and the robust taxonomy will facilitate and improve high-throughput anaerobic fungal community structure analysis of samples from various environments.},

  abstract = {Microbial symbioses have evolved repeatedly across the tree of life, but the genetic changes underlying transitions to symbiosis are largely unknown, especially for eukaryotic microbial symbionts. We used the genus Amanita, an iconic group of mushroom-forming fungi engaged in ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, to identify both the origins and potential genetic changes maintaining the stability of this mutualism. A multi-gene phylogeny reveals one origin of the symbiosis within Amanita, with a single transition from saprotrophic decomposition of dead organic matter to biotrophic dependence on host plants for carbon. Associated with this transition are the losses of two cellulase genes, each of which plays a critical role in extracellular decomposition of organic matter. However a third gene, which acts at later stages in cellulose decomposition, is retained by many, but not all, ectomycorrhizal species. Experiments confirm that symbiotic Amanita species have lost the ability to grow on complex organic matter and have therefore lost the capacity to live in forest soils without carbon supplied by a host plant. Irreversible losses of decomposition pathways are likely to play key roles in the evolutionary stability of these ubiquitous mutualisms.},

  abstract = {The phylogenetic relationships, taxonomy and biogeography of the genus Amanita with emphasis on eastern Asian species were estimated using sequence data from both internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and large subunit (nLSU) of nuclear ribosomal DNA. The separation of the two traditionally accepted subgenera was not well supported. Each section of Amanita, Vaginatae, Caesareae, Phalloideae, Validae and Amidella was supported as monophyletic by different methods of analysis and data sets of different regions. The monophyly of section Lepidella remained unclear. A few biogeographic and taxonomic implications were inferred: (1) few species of Amanita are widely distributed throughout eastern Asia, Europe and North America. Samples of some previously recognized disjunct species in the Northern Hemisphere were not monophyletic. Thus, the putative intercontinental disjunct distributions of these species were not supported in this study; (2) biogeographic relationships between Amanita of eastern Asia and Europe are relatively close and several taxa are common to both regions, while paired or closely related species between eastern Asia and North America are relatively common, but rarely have been confirmed as disjunct populations of the same species by molecular data yet. A number of species of Amanita in North America labelled with names based on European materials should be regarded as distinct species; (3) a few genetically cryptic species of Amanita in southwestern China need to be delimited; and (4) variations in colour and morphology of the fruit bodies in A. parvipantherina from different localities should be interpreted as modifications of environment.},

In particular, gene trees and species trees can differ due to well-known evolutionary processes such as gene duplication and loss, lateral gene transfer, or incomplete lineage sorting. Species tree reconstruction methods have been developed to take this incongruence into account; these can be divided grossly into supertree and supermatrix approaches. Here we introduce a new Bayesian hierarchical model that we have recently developed and implemented in the program guenomu. The new model considers multiple sources of gene tree/species tree disagreement. Guenomu takes as input posterior distributions of unrooted gene tree topologies for multiple gene families, in order to estimate the posterior distribution of rooted species tree topologies.},

  abstract = {Recombination between nucleotide sequences is a major process influencing the evolution of most species on Earth. The evolutionary value of recombination has been widely debated and so too has its influence on evolutionary analysis methods that assume nucleotide sequences replicate without recombining. When nucleic acids recombine, the evolution of the daughter or recombinant molecule cannot be accurately described by a single phylogeny. This simple fact can seriously undermine the accuracy of any phylogenetics-based analytical approach which assumes that the evolutionary history of a set of recombining sequences can be adequately described by a single phylogenetic tree. There are presently a large number of available methods and associated computer programs for analyzing and characterizing recombination in various classes of nucleotide sequence datasets. Here we examine the use of some of these methods to derive and test recombination hypotheses using multiple sequence alignments.},

  abstract = {Lateral genetic transfer (LGT) is the process by which genetic material moves between organisms (and viruses) in the biosphere. Among the many approaches developed for the inference of LGT events from DNA sequence data, methods based on the comparison of phylogenetic trees remain the gold standard for many types of problem. Identifying LGT events from sequenced genomes typically involves a series of steps in which homologous sequences are identified and aligned, phylogenetic trees are inferred, and their topologies are compared to identify unexpected or conflicting relationships. These types of approach have been used to elucidate the nature and extent of LGT and its physiological and ecological consequences throughout the Tree of Life. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to enormous increases in the number of sequenced genomes, including ultra-deep sampling of specific taxonomic groups and single cell-based sequencing of unculturable “microbial dark matter.” Environmental shotgun sequencing enables the study of LGT among organisms that share the same habitat.This abundance of genomic data offers new opportunities for scientific discovery, but poses two key problems. As ever more genomes are generated, the assembly and annotation of each individual genome receives less scrutiny; and with so many genomes available it is tempting to include them all in a single analysis, but thousands of genomes and millions of genes can overwhelm key algorithms in the analysis pipeline. Identifying LGT events of interest therefore depends on choosing the right dataset, and on algorithms that appropriately balance speed and accuracy given the size and composition of the chosen set of genomes.},

  abstract = {Genome sequencing is an important step toward correlating genotypes with phenotypic characters. Sequencing technologies are important in many fields in the life sciences, including functional genomics, transcriptomics, oncology, evolutionary biology, forensic sciences, and many more. The era of sequencing has been divided into three generations. First generation sequencing involved sequencing by synthesis (Sanger sequencing) and sequencing by cleavage (Maxam-Gilbert sequencing). Sanger sequencing led to the completion of various genome sequences (including human) and provided the foundation for development of other sequencing technologies. Since then, various techniques have been developed which can overcome some of the limitations of Sanger sequencing. These techniques are collectively known as “Next-generation sequencing” (NGS), and are further classified into second and third generation technologies. Although NGS methods have many advantages in terms of speed, cost, and parallelism, the accuracy and read length of Sanger sequencing is still superior and has confined the use of NGS mainly to resequencing genomes. Consequently, there is a continuing need to develop improved real time sequencing techniques. This chapter reviews some of the options currently available and provides a generic workflow for sequencing a genome.},

  abstract = {Molecular evolution can reveal the relationship between sets of homologous sequences and the patterns of change that occur during their evolution. An important aspect of these studies is the inference of a phylogenetic tree, which explicitly describes evolutionary relationships between homologous sequences. This chapter provides an introduction to evolutionary trees and how to infer them from sequence data using some commonly used inferential methodology. It focuses on statistical methods for inferring trees and how to assess the confidence one should have in any resulting tree, with a particular emphasis on the underlying assumptions of the methods and how they might affect the tree estimate. There is also some discussion of the underlying algorithms used to perform tree search and recommendations regarding the performance of different algorithms. Finally, there are a few practical guidelines, including how to combine multiple software packages to improve inference, and a comparison between Bayesian and Maximum likelihood phylogenetics.},

The aim of this chapter is to provide practical procedures to determine a protein crystal structure, illustrating the new techniques, experimental methods, and software that have made protein crystallography a tool accessible to a larger scientific community.It is impossible to give more than a taste of what the X-ray crystallographic technique entails in one brief chapter and there are different ways to solve a protein structure. Since the number of structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is becoming ever larger (the protein data bank now contains more than 100,000 entries) and therefore the probability to find a good model to solve the structure is ever increasing, we focus our attention on the Molecular Replacement method. Indeed, whenever applicable, this method allows the resolution of macromolecular structures starting from a single data set and a search model downloaded from the PDB, with the aid only of computer work.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide a phylogenetic overview of Basidiomycota and related phyla in relation to ten years of DNA based phylogenetic studies since the AFTOL publications in 2007. We selected 529 species to address phylogenetic relationships of higher-level taxa using a maximum-likelihood framework and sequence data from six genes traditionally used in fungal molecular systematics (nrLSU, nrSSU, 5.8S, tef1-α, rpb1 and rpb2). These species represent 18 classes, 62 orders, 183 families, and 392 genera from the phyla Basidiomycota (including the newly recognized subphylum Wallemiomycotina) and Entorrhizomycota, and 13 species representing 13 classes of Ascomycota as outgroup taxa. We also conducted a molecular dating analysis based on these six genes for 116 species representing 17 classes and 54 orders of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota. Finally we performed a phyloproteomics analysis from 109 Basidiomycota species and 6 outgroup taxa using amino-acid sequences retrieved from 396 orthologous genes. Recognition of higher taxa follows the criteria in Zhao et al (Fungal Divers 78:239–292, 2016): (i) taxa must be monophyletic and statistically well-supported in molecular dating analyses, (ii) their respective stem ages should be roughly equivalent, and (iii) stem ages of higher taxa must be older than those of lower level taxa. The time-tree indicates that the mean of stem ages of Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota are ca. 530 Ma; subphyla of Basidiomycota are 406–490 Ma; most classes are 358–393 Ma for those of Agaricomycotina and 245–356 Ma for those of Pucciniomycotina and Ustilaginomycotina; most orders of those subphyla split 120–290 Ma. Monophyly of most higher-level taxa of Basidiomycota are generally supported, especially those taxa introduced in the recent ten years: phylum Entorrhizomycota, classes Malasseziomycetes, Moniliellomycetes, Spiculogloeomycetes, Tritirachiomycetes and orders Amylocorticiales, Golubeviales, Holtermanniales, Jaapiales, Lepidostromatales, Robbauerales, Stereopsidales and Trichosporonales. However, the younger divergence times of Leucosporidiales (Microbotryomycetes) indicate that its order status is not supported, thus we propose combining it under Microbotryales. On the other hand, the families Buckleyzymaceae and Sakaguchiaceae (Cystobasidiomycetes) are raised to Buckleyzymales and Sakaguchiales due to their older divergence times. Cystofilobasidiales (Tremellomycetes) has an older divergence time and should be amended to a higher rank. We however, do not introduce it as new class here for Cystofilobasidiales, as DNA sequences from these taxa are not from their respective types and thus await further studies. Divergence times for Exobasidiomycetes, Cantharellales, Gomphales and Hysterangiales were obtained based on limited species sequences in molecular dating study. More comprehensive phylogenetic studies on those four taxa are needed in the future because our ML analysis based on wider sampling, shows they are not monophyletic groups. In general, the six-gene phylogenies are in agreement with the phyloproteomics tree except for the placements of Wallemiomycotina, orders Amylocorticiales, Auriculariales, Cantharellales, Geastrales, Sebacinales and Trechisporales from Agaricomycetes. These conflicting placements in the six-gene phylogeny vs the phyloproteomics tree are discussed. This leads to future perspectives for assessing gene orthology and problems in deciphering taxon ranks using divergence times.},

  abstract = {Exploring the secondary structure information of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) has been a promising approach in species delimitation. However, Compensatory base changes (CBC) concept employed in this approach turns futile when CBC is absent. This prompted us to investigate the utility of insertion/deletion (INDELs) and substitutions in fungal delineation at species level. Upon this rationale, 116 strains representing 97 species, belonging to 6 genera (Colletotrichum, Boeremia, Leptosphaeria, Peyronellaea, Plenodomus and Stagonosporopsis) of Ascomycota were retrieved from Q-bank for molecular morphometric analysis. CBC, INDELs and substitutions between the species of their respective genus were recorded. Most species combinations lacked CBC. Among the substitution events, transitions were predominant. INDELs were less frequent than the substitutions. These evolutionary events were mapped upon the helices to discern species specific variation sites. In 68 species unique variation sites were recognised. The remaining 29 species shared absolute similarity with distinctly named species. The variation sites catalogued in them overlapped with other distinct species and resulted in blurring of the species boundaries. Species specific variation sites recognized in this study are the preliminary results and they could be discerned with absolute confidence when larger datasets encompassing all described species of genera were investigated. They could be of potential use in barcoding fungi at species level. This study also concludes that the ITS2 molecular morphometric analysis is an efficient third dimensional study of the fungal species delimitation. This may help to avoid the false positives in species delimitations and to alleviate the challenges in molecular characterization.},

Hence in this study, foliar endophytic fungal (FEF) assemblages in three Magnoliopsida plants were delimited using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence—secondary structural features based phylogenetic analysis, also known as molecular morphometrics. A total of 392 FEF isolates were obtained from the Aglaia elaeagnoidea, Flacourtia inermis, and Premna serratifolia leaves and grouped into 98 morphotypes. Among these host plants, P. serratifolia showed the maximum percentage of colonization frequency. Representatives of each morphotype was sequenced and subjected to further molecular characterization. The results revealed that morphotypes were belonged to the phylum of Ascomycota, distributed over two classes (Sordariomycetes (68.59\%) and Dothideomycetes (31.41\%)), 6 orders and 19 genera. Based on compensatory base changes (CBC) analysis and absolute identity of ITS2 structure, 21, 20 and 23 species were recognized from A. elaeagnoidea, F. inermis, and P. serratifolia respectively. Diversity indices were higher in A. elaeagnoidea, despite it accounted for a modest 16.8\% of total isolates recorded in this study. The genus Colletotrichum was predominant in A. elaeagnoidea (39\%) and P. serratifolia (48\%). Similarly, Diaporthe (43\%) was dominant in F. inermis. Several host-specific species were also observed. This study concludes that these plants host diverse species of Ascomycota. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on FEF diversity from these plants. Also, the inclusion of ITS2 secondary structure information along with the sequence provides a further dimension to resolve the inherent problems in identification of fungal species.},

  abstract = {Amazonia is an environmentally heterogeneous and biologically megadiverse region, and its biodiversity varies considerably over space. However, existing knowledge on Amazonian biodiversity and its environmental determinants stems almost exclusively from studies of macroscopic above-ground organisms, notably vertebrates and trees. In contrast, diversity patterns of most other organisms remain elusive, although some of them, for instance microorganisms, constitute the overwhelming majority of taxa in any given location, both in terms of diversity and abundance. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding to estimate prokaryote and eukaryote diversity in environmental soil and litter samples from 39 survey plots in a longitudinal transect across Brazilian Amazonia using 16S and 18S gene sequences, respectively. We characterize richness and community composition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and test their correlation with longitude and habitat. We find that prokaryote and eukaryote OTU richness and community composition differ significantly among localities and habitats, and that prokaryotes are more strongly structured by locality and habitat type than eukaryotes. Our results 1) provide a first large-scale mapping of Amazonian soil biodiversity, suggesting that OTU richness patterns might follow substantially different patterns from those observed for macro-organisms; and 2) indicate that locality and habitat factors interact in determining OTU richness patterns and community composition. This study shows the potential of DNA metabarcoding in unveiling Amazonia's outstanding diversity, despite the lack of complete reference sequence databases for the organisms sequenced.},

However, new environmental fungal lineages known only from DNA data reveal significant gaps in our sampling of the fungal kingdom in terms of both taxonomy and marker coverage in the reference sequence databases. To facilitate the integration of reference data from all of the ribosomal markers, we present three sets of general primers that allow for amplification of the complete ribosomal operon from the ribosomal tandem repeats. The primers cover all ribosomal markers: ETS, SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, LSU and IGS. We coupled these primers successfully with third-generation sequencing (PacBio and Nanopore sequencing) to showcase our approach on authentic fungal herbarium specimens (Basidiomycota), aquatic chytrids (Chytridiomycota) and a poorly understood lineage of early diverging fungi (Nephridiophagidae). In particular, we were able to generate high-quality reference data with Nanopore sequencing in a high-throughput manner, showing that the generation of reference data can be achieved on a regular desktop computer without the involvement of any large-scale sequencing facility. The quality of the Nanopore generated sequences was 99.85\%, which is comparable with the 99.78\% accuracy described for Sanger sequencing. With this work, we hope to stimulate the generation of a new comprehensive standard of ribosomal reference data with the ultimate aim to close the huge gaps in our reference datasets.},

  abstract = {Nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes represent the oldest repetitive fraction universal to all eukaryotic genomes. Their deeply anchored universality and omnipresence during eukaryotic evolution reflects in multiple roles and functions reaching far beyond ribosomal synthesis. Merely the copy number of non-transcribed rRNA genes is involved in mechanisms governing e.g., maintenance of genome integrity and control of cellular aging. Their copy number can vary in response to environmental cues, in cellular stress sensing, in development of cancer and other diseases. While reaching hundreds of copies in humans, there are records of up to 20,000 copies in fish and frogs and even 400,000 copies in ciliates forming thus a literal subgenome or an rDNAome within the genome. From the compositional and evolutionary dynamics viewpoint, the precursor 45S rDNA represents universally GC-enriched, highly recombining and homogenized regions. Hence, it is not accidental that both rDNA sequence and the corresponding rRNA secondary structure belong to established phylogenetic markers broadly used to infer phylogeny on multiple taxonomical levels including species delimitation. However, these multiple roles of rDNAs have been treated and discussed as being separate and independent from each other. Here, I aim to address nuclear rDNAs in an integrative approach to better assess the complexity of rDNA importance in the evolutionary context.},

In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs forming the 40S and 60S subunits are borne by a long polycistronic pre-ribosomal RNA. A complex sequence of processing steps is required to gradually release the mature RNAs from this precursor, concomitant with the assembly of the 79 ribosomal proteins. A large set of trans-acting factors chaperone this process, including small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles. While yeast has been the gold standard for studying the molecular basis of this process, recent technical advances have allowed to further define the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis in animals and plants. This renewed interest for a long-lasting question has been fueled by the association of several genetic diseases with mutations in genes encoding both ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors, and by the perspective of new anticancer treatments targeting the mechanisms of ribosome synthesis. A consensus scheme of pre-ribosomal RNA maturation is emerging from studies in various kinds of eukaryotic organisms.

Also, in all organisms, rRNA processing occurs inside large preribosomal particles and is coupled to nucleotide modification, folding of the precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA), and assembly of the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). In this review, we focus on the processing pathway of pre-rRNAs of cytoplasmic ribosomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, without doubt, the organism where this pathway is best characterized. We summarize the current understanding of the rRNA maturation process, particularly focusing on the pre-rRNA processing sites, the enzymes responsible for the cleavage or trimming reactions and the different mechanisms that monitor and regulate the pathway. Strikingly, the overall order of the various processing steps is reasonably well conserved in eukaryotes, perhaps reflecting common principles for orchestrating the concomitant events of pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly.},

The PacBio protocol for preparation of sequencing templates employs blunt-end hairpin adapter ligation, which enables a short turnaround time for sequence production. However, we have found a significant portion of sequencing yield contains chimeric reads resulting from blunt-end ligation of multiple template molecules to each other prior to adapter ligation. These artefactual fusion DNA sequences pose a major challenge to analysis and can lead to false-positive detection of fusion events. We assessed the frequency of artefactual fusion when using blunt-end adapter ligation and compared it to an alternative method using A/T overhang adapter ligation.

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {Savannah regions are predicted to undergo changes in precipitation patterns according to current climate change projections. This change will affect leaf phenology, which controls net primary productivity. It is of importance to study this since savannahs play an important role in the global carbon cycle due to their areal coverage and can have an effect on the food security in regions that depend on subsistence farming. In this study we investigate how soil moisture, mean annual precipitation, and day length control savannah phenology by developing a lagged time series model. The model uses climate data for 15 flux tower sites across four continents, and normalized difference vegetation index from satellite to optimize a statistical phenological model. We show that all three variables can be used to estimate savannah phenology on a global scale. However, it was not possible to create a simplified savannah model that works equally well for all sites on the global scale without inclusion of more site specific parameters. The simplified model showed no bias towards tree cover or between continents and resulted in a cross-validated r2 of 0.6 and root mean squared error of 0.1. We therefore expect similar average results when applying the model to other savannah areas and further expect that it could be used to estimate the productivity of savannah regions.},

  abstract = {The idea that many processes in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are dormant until activated by a pulse of rainfall, and then decay from a maximum rate as the soil dries, is widely used as a conceptual and mathematical model, but has rarely been evaluated with data. This paper examines soil water, evapotranspiration (ET), and net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured for 5 years at an eddy covariance tower sited in an Acacia–Combretum savanna near Skukuza in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The analysis characterizes ecosystem flux responses to discrete rain events and evaluates the skill of increasingly complex “pulse models”. Rainfall pulses exert strong control over ecosystem-scale water and CO2 fluxes at this site, but the simplest pulse models do a poor job of characterizing the dynamics of the response. Successful models need to include the time lag between the wetting event and the process peak, which differ for evaporation, photosynthesis and respiration. Adding further complexity, the time lag depends on the prior duration and degree of water stress. ET response is well characterized by a linear function of potential ET and a logistic function of profile-total soil water content, with remaining seasonal variation correlating with vegetation phenological dynamics (leaf area). A 1- to 3-day lag to maximal ET following wetting is a source of hysteresis in the ET response to soil water. Respiration responds to wetting within days, while photosynthesis takes a week or longer to reach its peak if the rainfall was preceded by a long dry spell. Both processes exhibit nonlinear functional responses that vary seasonally. We conclude that a more mechanistic approach than simple pulse modeling is needed to represent daily ecosystem C processes in semiarid savannas.},

  abstract = {The ‘two-layer’ and ‘pulse-reserve’ hypotheses were developed 30 years ago and continue to serve as the standard for many experiments and modeling studies that examine relationships between primary productivity and rainfall variability in aridlands. The two-layer hypothesis considers two important plant functional types (FTs) and predicts that woody and herbaceous plants are able to co-exist in savannas because they utilize water from different soil layers (or depths). The pulse-reserve model addresses the response of individual plants to precipitation and predicts that there are ‘biologically important’ rain events that stimulate plant growth and reproduction. These pulses of precipitation may play a key role in long-term plant function and survival (as compared to seasonal or annual rainfall totals as per the two-layer model). In this paper, we re-evaluate these paradigms in terms of their generality, strengths, and limitations. We suggest that while seasonality and resource partitioning (key to the two-layer model) and biologically important precipitation events (key to the pulse-reserve model) are critical to understanding plant responses to precipitation in aridlands, both paradigms have significant limitations. Neither account for plasticity in rooting habits of woody plants, potential delayed responses of plants to rainfall, explicit precipitation thresholds, or vagaries in plant phenology. To address these limitations, we integrate the ideas of precipitation thresholds and plant delays, resource partitioning, and plant FT strategies into a simple ‘threshold-delay’ model. The model contains six basic parameters that capture the nonlinear nature of plant responses to pulse precipitation. We review the literature within the context of our threshold-delay model to: (i) develop testable hypotheses about how different plant FTs respond to pulses; (ii) identify weaknesses in the current state-of-knowledge; and (iii) suggest future research directions that will provide insight into how the timing, frequency, and magnitude of rainfall in deserts affect plants, plant communities, and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In arid/semi-arid ecosystems, biological resources, such as water, soil nutrients, and plant biomass, typically go through periods of high and low abundance. Short periods of high resource abundance are usually triggered by rainfall events, which, despite of the overall scarcity of rain, can saturate the resource demand of some biological processes for a time. This review develops the idea that there exists a hierarchy of soil moisture pulse events with a corresponding hierarchy of ecological responses, such that small pulses only trigger a small number of relatively minor ecological events, and larger pulses trigger a more inclusive set and some larger ecological events. This framework hinges on the observation that many biological state changes, where organisms transition from a state of lower to higher physiological activity, require a minimal triggering event size. Response thresholds are often determined by the ability of organisms to utilize soil moisture pulses of different infiltration depth or duration. For example, brief, shallow pulses can only affect surface dwelling organisms with fast response times and high tolerance for low resource levels, such as some species of the soil micro-fauna and -flora, while it takes more water and deeper infiltration to affect the physiology, growth or reproduction of higher plants. This review first discusses how precipitation, climate and site factors translate into soil moisture pulses of varying magnitude and duration. Next, the idea of the response hierarchy for ecosystem processes is developed, followed by an exploration of the possible evolutionary background for the existence of response thresholds to resource pulses. The review concludes with an outlook on global change: does the hierarchical view of precipitation effects in ecosystems provide new perspectives on the future of arid/semiarid lands?},

  abstract = {Deserts are characterized by low productivity and substantial unvegetated space, which is often covered by soil microbial crust communities. Microbial crusts are important for nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization and water infiltration, but their role in ecosystem production is not well understood. This study addresses the following questions: what are the CO2 exchange responses of crusts to pulses of water, does the contribution of crusts to ecosystem flux differ from the soil respiratory flux, and is this contribution pulse size dependent? Following water application to crusts and soils, CO2 exchange was measured and respiration was partitioned through mixing model analysis of Keeling plots across treatments. Following small precipitation pulse sizes, crusts contributed 80\% of soil-level CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere. However, following a large pulse event, roots and soil microbes contributed nearly 100\% of the soil-level flux. Rainfall events in southern Arizona are dominated by small pulse sizes, suggesting that crusts may frequently contribute to ecosystem production. Carbon cycle studies of arid land systems should consider crusts as important contributors because of their dynamic responses to different pulse sizes as compared to the remaining ecosystem components.},

  abstract = {Water conservation is important for plants that maintain physiologically active foliage during prolonged periods of drought. A variety of mechanisms for water conservation exist including stomatal regulation, foliage loss, above- and below-ground allocation patterns, size of xylem vessels and leaf pubescence. Using the results of a field and simulation study with Artemisia tridentata in the Great Basin, USA, we propose an additional mechanism of water conservation that can be used by plants in arid and semi-arid environments following pulses of water availability. Precipitation redistributed more uniformly in the soil column by roots (hydraulic redistribution of water downward) slows the rate at which this water can subsequently be taken up by plants, thus prolonging water availability during periods of drought. By spreading out water more uniformly in the soil column at lower water potentials following precipitation events, water use is reduced due to lower soil conductivity. The greater remaining soil water and more uniform distribution result in higher plant predawn water potentials and transpiration rates later in the drought period. Simulation results indicate that plants can benefit during drought periods from water storage following both summer rain events (small summer pulses) and overwinter recharge (large spring pulse). This mechanism of water conservation may aid in sustaining active foliage, maintaining root-soil hydraulic connectivity, and increasing survival probability of plants which remain physiologically active during periods of drought.},

  abstract = {In dryland ecosystems, the timing and magnitude of precipitation pulses drive many key ecological processes, notably soil water availability for plants and soil microbiota. Plant available water has frequently been viewed simply as incoming precipitation, yet processes at larger scales drive precipitation pulses, and the subsequent transformation of precipitation pulses to plant available water are complex. We provide an overview of the factors that influence the spatial and temporal availability of water to plants and soil biota using examples from western USA drylands. Large spatial- and temporal-scale drivers of regional precipitation patterns include the position of the jet streams and frontal boundaries, the North American Monsoon, El Niño Southern Oscillation events, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Topography and orography modify the patterns set up by the larger-scale drivers, resulting in regional patterns (102–106 km2) of precipitation magnitude, timing, and variation. Together, the large-scale and regional drivers impose important pulsed patterns on long-term precipitation trends at landscape scales, in which most site precipitation is received as small events ({$<$}5 mm) and with most of the intervals between events being short ({$<$}10 days). The drivers also influence the translation of precipitation events into available water via linkages between soil water content and components of the water budget, including interception, infiltration and runoff, soil evaporation, plant water use and hydraulic redistribution, and seepage below the rooting zone. Soil water content varies not only vertically with depth but also horizontally beneath versus between plants and/or soil crusts in ways that are ecologically important to different plant and crust types. We highlight the importance of considering larger-scale drivers, and their effects on regional patterns; small, frequent precipitation events; and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in soil water content in translating from climatology to precipitation pulses to the dryland ecohydrology of water availability for plants and soil biota.},

  abstract = {Resource availability is often characterized by mean annual amounts, while ignoring the spatial variation within habitats and the temporal variation within a year. Yet, temporal and spatial variation may be especially important for identifying the source of stress in low productivity environments such as deserts where resources are often pulsed and resource renewal events are separated by long periods of low resource availability. Therefore, the degree of stress will be determined in part by the length of time between recharge events. Here, we investigated the effect of timing and total amount of water application on two congeneric pairs, each with a population from a low (desert) and a high (Mediterranean) productivity habitat. As expected, highest survival and greatest growth were found at low or intermediate recharge intervals, and the magnitude of response to increases in total seasonal amounts was greater for Mediterranean species than desert species. The species that had greater survival switched in the hierarchy under high total water depending on interval length. These results demonstrate that temporal variation in resource availability can be as important as annual total amounts for plant performance and that response to temporal dynamics can vary between species. This has implications for community-level processes, as competitive hierarchies may switch based on resource dynamics rather than only total availability.},

  abstract = {There is concern about the lack of recruitment of Acacia trees in the Negev desert of Israel. We have developed three models to estimate the frequency of recruitment necessary for long-term population survival (i.e. positive average population growth for 1,000 years and {$<$}10\% probability of extinction). Two models assume purely episodic recruitment based on the general notion that recruitment in arid environments is highly episodic. They differ in that the deterministic model investigates average dynamics while the stochastic model does not. Studies indicating that recruitment episodes in arid environments have been overemphasized motivated the development of the third model. This semi-stochastic model simulates a mixture of continuous and episodic recruitment. Model analysis was done analytically for the deterministic model and via running model simulations for the stochastic and semi-stochastic models. The deterministic and stochastic models predict that, on average, 2.2 and 3.7 recruitment events per century, respectively, are necessary to sustain the population. According to the semi-stochastic model, 1.6 large recruitment events per century and an annual probability of 50\% that a small recruitment event occurs are needed. A consequence of purely episodic recruitment is that all recruitment episodes produce extremely large numbers of recruits (i.e. at odds with field observations), an evaluation that holds even when considering that rare events must be large. Thus, the semi-stochastic model appears to be the most realistic model. Comparing the prediction of the semi-stochastic model to field observations in the Negev desert shows that the absence of observations of extremely large recruitment events is no reason for concern. However, the almost complete absence of small recruitment events is a serious reason for concern. The lack of recruitment may be due to decreased densities of large mammalian herbivores and might be further exacerbated by possible changes in climate, both in terms of average precipitation and the temporal distribution of rain.},

  abstract = {Biological soil crusts, a community of cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses that live on the soil surface, occur in deserts throughout the world. They are a critical component of desert ecosystems, as they are important contributors to soil fertility and stability. Future climate scenarios predict alteration of the timing and amount of precipitation in desert environments. Because biological soil crust organisms are only metabolically active when wet, and as soil surfaces dry quickly in deserts during late spring, summer, and early fall, the amount and timing of precipitation is likely to have significant impacts on the physiological functioning of these communities. Using the three dominant soil crust types found in the western United States, we applied three levels of precipitation frequency (50\% below-average, average, and 50\% above-average) while maintaining average precipitation amount (therefore changing both timing and size of applied events). We measured the impact of these treatments on photosynthetic performance (as indicated by dark-adapted quantum yield and chlorophyll a concentrations), nitrogenase activity, and the ability of these organisms to maintain concentrations of radiation-protective pigments (scytonemin, beta-carotene, echinenone, xanthophylls, and canthaxanthin). Increased precipitation frequency produced little response after 2.5 months exposure during spring (1 April–15 June) or summer (15 June–31 August). In contrast, most of the above variables had a large, negative response after exposure to increased precipitation frequency for 6 months spring–fall (1 April–31 October) treatment. The crusts dominated by the soil lichen Collema, being dark and protruding above the surface, dried the most rapidly, followed by the dark surface cyanobacterial crusts (Nostoc-Scytonema-Microcoleus), and then by the light cyanobacterial crusts (Microcoleus). This order reflected the magnitude of the observed response: crusts dominated by the lichen Collema showed the largest decline in quantum yield, chlorophyll a, and protective pigments; crusts dominated by Nostoc-Scytonema-Microcoleus showed an intermediate decline in these variables; and the crusts dominated by Microcoleus showed the least negative response. Most previous studies of crust response to radiation stress have been short-term laboratory studies, where organisms were watered and kept under moderate temperatures. Such conditions would give crust organisms access to ample carbon to respond to imposed stresses (e.g., production of UV-protective pigments, replacement of degraded chlorophyll). In contrast, our longer-term study showed that under field conditions of high air temperatures and frequent, small precipitation events, crust organisms appear unable to produce protective pigments in response to radiation stress, as they likely dried more quickly than when they received larger, less frequent events. Reduced activity time likely resulted in less carbon available to produce or repair chlorophyll a and/or protective pigments. Our findings may partially explain the global observation that soil lichen cover and richness declines as the frequency of summer rainfall increases.},

  abstract = {Plant species and functionally related species groups from arid and semi-arid habitats vary in their capacity to take up summer precipitation, acquire nitrogen quickly after summer precipitation, and subsequently respond with ecophysiological changes (e.g. water and nitrogen relations, gas exchange). For species that respond ecophysiologically, the use of summer precipitation is generally assumed to affect long-term plant growth and thus alter competitive interactions that structure plant communities and determine potential responses to climate change. We assessed ecophysiological and growth responses to large short-term irrigation pulses over one to three growing seasons for several widespread Great Basin and northern Mojave Desert shrub species: Chrysothamnus nauseosus, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Atriplex confertifolia, and A. parryi. We compared control and watered plants in nine case studies that encompassed adults of all four species, juveniles for three of the species, and two sites for two of the species. In every comparison, plants used summer water pulses to improve plant water status or increase rates of functioning as indicated by other ecophysiological characters. Species and life history stage responses of ecophysiological parameters (leaf N, δ15N, δ13C, gas exchange, sap flow) were consistent with several previous short-term studies. However, use of summer water pulses did not affect canopy growth in eight out of nine comparisons, despite the range of species, growth stages, and site conditions. Summer water pulses affected canopy growth only for C. nauseosus adults. The general lack of growth effects for these species might be due to close proximity of groundwater at these sites, co-limitation by nutrients, or inability to respond due to phenological canalization. An understanding of the connections between short-term ecophysiological responses and growth, for different habitats and species, is critical for determining the significance of summer precipitation for desert community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Arid environments are characterized by limited and variable rainfall that supplies resources in pulses. Resource pulsing is a special form of environmental variation, and the general theory of coexistence in variable environments suggests specific mechanisms by which rainfall variability might contribute to the maintenance of high species diversity in arid ecosystems. In this review, we discuss physiological, morphological, and life-history traits that facilitate plant survival and growth in strongly water-limited variable environments, outlining how species differences in these traits may promote diversity. Our analysis emphasizes that the variability of pulsed environments does not reduce the importance of species interactions in structuring communities, but instead provides axes of ecological differentiation between species that facilitate their coexistence. Pulses of rainfall also influence higher trophic levels and entire food webs. Better understanding of how rainfall affects the diversity, species composition, and dynamics of arid environments can contribute to solving environmental problems stemming from land use and global climate change.},

  abstract = {The episodic nature of water availability in arid and semiarid ecosystems has significant consequences on belowground carbon and nutrient cycling. Pulsed water events directly control belowground processes through soil wet-dry cycles. Rapid soil microbial response to incident moisture availability often results in almost instantaneous C and N mineralization, followed by shifts in C/N of microbially available substrate, and an offset in the balance between nutrient immobilization and mineralization. Nitrogen inputs from biological soil crusts are also highly sensitive to pulsed rain events, and nitrogen losses, particularly gaseous losses due to denitrification and nitrate leaching, are tightly linked to pulses of water availability. The magnitude of the effect of water pulses on carbon and nutrient pools, however, depends on the distribution of resource availability and soil organisms, both of which are strongly affected by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of vegetation cover, topographic position and soil texture. The ‘inverse texture hypothesis’ for net primary production in water-limited ecosystems suggests that coarse-textured soils have higher NPP than fine-textured soils in very arid zones due to reduced evaporative losses, while NPP is greater in fine-textured soils in higher rainfall ecosystems due to increased water-holding capacity. With respect to belowground processes, fine-textured soils tend to have higher water-holding capacity and labile C and N pools than coarse-textured soils, and often show a much greater flush of N mineralization. The result of the interaction of texture and pulsed rainfall events suggests a corollary hypothesis for nutrient turnover in arid and semiarid ecosystems with a linear increase of N mineralization in coarse-textured soils, but a saturating response for fine-textured soils due to the importance of soil C and N pools. Seasonal distribution of water pulses can lead to the accumulation of mineral N in the dry season, decoupling resource supply and microbial and plant demand, and resulting in increased losses via other pathways and reduction in overall soil nutrient pools. The asynchrony of resource availability, particularly nitrogen versus water due to pulsed water events, may be central to understanding the consequences for ecosystem nutrient retention and long-term effects on carbon and nutrient pools. Finally, global change effects due to changes in the nature and size of pulsed water events and increased asynchrony of water availability and growing season will likely have impacts on biogeochemical cycling in water-limited ecosystems.},

  abstract = {In the arid and semiarid regions of North America, discrete precipitation pulses are important triggers for biological activity. The timing and magnitude of these pulses may differentially affect the activity of plants and microbes, combining to influence the C balance of desert ecosystems. Here, we evaluate how a “pulse” of water influences physiological activity in plants, soils and ecosystems, and how characteristics, such as precipitation pulse size and frequency are important controllers of biological and physical processes in arid land ecosystems. We show that pulse size regulates C balance by determining the temporal duration of activity for different components of the biota. Microbial respiration responds to very small events, but the relationship between pulse size and duration of activity likely saturates at moderate event sizes. Photosynthetic activity of vascular plants generally increases following relatively larger pulses or a series of small pulses. In this case, the duration of physiological activity is an increasing function of pulse size up to events that are infrequent in these hydroclimatological regions. This differential responsiveness of photosynthesis and respiration results in arid ecosystems acting as immediate C sources to the atmosphere following rainfall, with subsequent periods of C accumulation should pulse size be sufficient to initiate vascular plant activity. Using the average pulse size distributions in the North American deserts, a simple modeling exercise shows that net ecosystem exchange of CO2 is sensitive to changes in the event size distribution representative of wet and dry years. An important regulator of the pulse response is initial soil and canopy conditions and the physical structuring of bare soil and beneath canopy patches on the landscape. Initial condition influences responses to pulses of varying magnitude, while bare soil/beneath canopy patches interact to introduce nonlinearity in the relationship between pulse size and soil water response. Building on this conceptual framework and developing a greater understanding of the complexities of these eco-hydrologic systems may enhance our ability to describe the ecology of desert ecosystems and their sensitivity to global change.},

In a two-factor greenhouse experiment, doubling the total volume of water added led to greater germination (measured as number of germinated seeds and species) and establishment (survival and biomass) but the effects of temporal variability depended on the response variable considered. Low pulse frequencies of water addition with total volume added held constant resulted in greater temporal variability in soil moisture concentration that in turn promoted higher density and richness of germinated seedlings. Low pulse frequencies caused an eight-fold greater mortality in the low total volume treatment and biomass production to decline by one-third in the high total volume treatment. The effects of increasing temporal variability in water supply during recruitment stages can thus be opposite on different components of plant fitness and may also depend on total resource quantity. While greater species richness in more temporally variable soil moisture conditions was attributable to sampling effects rather than species-specific responses to the water treatments, species relative abundances did vary significantly with temporal variability. Changes in the amplitude or frequency of resource fluctuations may alter recruitment patterns, and could have severe and relatively rapid effects on community structure in unproductive ecosystems.},

  shorttitle = {Modifying the ‘Pulse–Reserve’ Paradigm for Deserts of {{North America}}},
  abstract = {The ‘pulse–reserve’ conceptual model—arguably one of the most-cited paradigms in aridland ecology—depicts a simple, direct relationship between rainfall, which triggers pulses of plant growth, and reserves of carbon and energy. While the heuristics of ‘pulses’, ‘triggers’ and ‘reserves’ are intuitive and thus appealing, the value of the paradigm is limited, both as a conceptual model of how pulsed water inputs are translated into primary production and as a framework for developing quantitative models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a revision of the pulse–reserve model that emphasizes the following: (1) what explicitly constitutes a biologically significant ‘rainfall pulse’, (2) how do rainfall pulses translate into usable ‘soil moisture pulses’, and (3) how are soil moisture pulses differentially utilized by various plant functional types (FTs) in terms of growth? We explore these questions using the patch arid lands simulation (PALS) model for sites in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. Our analyses indicate that rainfall variability is best understood in terms of sequences of rainfall events that produce biologically-significant ‘pulses’ of soil moisture recharge, as opposed to individual rain events. In the desert regions investigated, biologically significant pulses of soil moisture occur in either winter (October–March) or summer (July–September), as determined by the period of activity of the plant FTs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to make generalizations regarding specific growth responses to moisture pulses, because of the strong effects of and interactions between precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, and plant FT responses, all of which vary among deserts and seasons. Our results further suggest that, in most soil types and in most seasons, there is little separation of soil water with depth. Thus, coexistence of plant FTs in a single patch as examined in this PALS study is likely to be fostered by factors that promote: (1) separation of water use over time (seasonal differences in growth), (2) relative differences in the utilization of water in the upper soil layers, or (3) separation in the responses of plant FTs as a function of preceding conditions, i.e., the physiological and morphological readiness of the plant for water-uptake and growth. Finally, the high seasonal and annual variability in soil water recharge and plant growth, which result from the complex interactions that occur as a result of rainfall variability, antecedent soil moisture conditions, nutrient availability, and plant FT composition and cover, call into question the use of simplified vegetation models in forecasting potential impacts of climate change in the arid zones in North America.},

  abstract = {Physiological activity and structural dynamics in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are driven by discrete inputs or “pulses” of growing season precipitation. Here we describe the short-term dynamics of ecosystem physiology in experimental stands of native (Heteropogon contortus) and invasive (Eragrostis lehmanniana) grasses to an irrigation pulse across two geomorphic surfaces with distinctly different soils: a Pleistocene-aged surface with high clay content in a strongly horizonated soil, and a Holocene-aged surface with low clay content in homogenously structured soils. We evaluated whole-ecosystem and leaf-level CO2 and H2O exchange, soil CO2 efflux, along with plant and soil water status to understand potential constraints on whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during the initiation of the summer monsoon season. Prior to the irrigation pulse, both invasive and native grasses had less negative pre-dawn water potentials (Ψpd), greater leaf photosynthetic rates (Anet) and stomatal conductance (gs), and greater rates of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) on the Pleistocene surface than on the Holocene. Twenty-four hours following the experimental application of a 39 mm irrigation pulse, soil CO2 efflux increased leading to all plots losing CO2 to the atmosphere over the course of a day. Invasive species stands had greater evapotranspiration rates (ET) immediately following the precipitation pulse than did native stands, while maximum instantaneous NEE increased for both species and surfaces at roughly the same rate. The differential ET patterns through time were correlated with an earlier decline in NEE in the invasive species as compared to the native species plots. Plots with invasive species accumulated between 5\% and 33\% of the carbon that plots with the native species accumulated over the 15-day pulse period. Taken together, these results indicate that system CO2 efflux (both the physical displacement of soil CO2 by water along with plant and microbial respiration) strongly controls whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during precipitation pulses. Since CO2 and H2O loss to the atmosphere was partially driven by species effects on soil microclimate, understanding the mechanistic relationships between the soil characteristics, plant ecophysiological responses, and canopy structural dynamics will be important for understanding the effects of shifting precipitation and vegetation patterns in semi-arid environments.},

In this study, we investigated soil moisture controls on phenology and productivity of an Acacia woodland in semi-arid central Australia. Situated on an extensive sand plain with negligible runoff and drainage, the carry-over of soil moisture content (θ) in the rhizosphere enabled the delay of phenology and productivity across seasons, until conditions were favourable for transpiration of that water to prevent overheating in the canopy. Storage of soil moisture near the surface (in the top few metres) was promoted by a siliceous hardpan. Pulsed recharge of θ above the hardpan was rapid and depended upon precipitation amount: 150mm storm−1 resulted in saturation of θ above the hardpan (i.e., formation of a temporary, discontinuous perched aquifer above the hardpan in unconsolidated soil) and immediate carbon uptake by the vegetation. During dry and inter-storm periods, we inferred the presence of hydraulic lift from soil storage above the hardpan to the surface due to (i) regular daily drawdown of θ in the reservoir that accumulates above the hardpan in the absence of drainage and evapotranspiration; (ii) the dimorphic root distribution wherein most roots were found in dry soil near the surface, but with significant root just above the hardpan; and (iii) synchronisation of phenology amongst trees and grasses in the dry season. We propose that hydraulic redistribution provides a small amount of moisture that maintains functioning of the shallow roots during long periods when the surface soil layer was dry, thereby enabling Mulga to maintain physiological activity without diminishing phenological and physiological responses to precipitation when conditions were favourable to promote canopy cooling.},

  abstract = {Although macroscopic plants, animals, and fungi are the most familiar eukaryotes, the bulk of eukaryotic diversity is microbial. Elucidating the timing of diversification among the more than 70 lineages is key to understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. Here, we use taxon-rich multigene data combined with diverse fossils and a relaxed molecular clock framework to estimate the timing of the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes and the divergence of major clades. Overall, these analyses suggest that the last common ancestor lived between 1866 and 1679 Ma, consistent with the earliest microfossils interpreted with confidence as eukaryotic. During this interval, the Earth's surface differed markedly from today; for example, the oceans were incompletely ventilated, with ferruginous and, after about 1800 Ma, sulfidic water masses commonly lying beneath moderately oxygenated surface waters. Our time estimates also indicate that the major clades of eukaryotes diverged before 1000 Ma, with most or all probably diverging before 1200 Ma. Fossils, however, suggest that diversity within major extant clades expanded later, beginning about 800 Ma, when the oceans began their transition to a more modern chemical state. In combination, paleontological and molecular approaches indicate that long stems preceded diversification in the major eukaryotic lineages.},

  abstract = {Animals and fungi independently evolved from the protozoan phylum Choanozoa, these three groups constituting a major branch of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree known as opisthokonts. Opisthokonts and the protozoan phylum Amoebozoa (amoebae plus slime moulds) were previously argued to have evolved independently from the little-studied, largely flagellate, protozoan phylum, Sulcozoa. Sulcozoa are a likely evolutionary link between opisthokonts and the more primitive excavate flagellates that have ventral feeding grooves and the most primitive known mitochondria. To extend earlier sparse evidence for the ancestral (paraphyletic) nature of Sulcozoa, we sequenced transcriptomes from six gliding flagellates (two apusomonads; three planomonads; Mantamonas). Phylogenetic analyses of 173–192 genes and 73–122 eukaryote-wide taxa show Sulcozoa as deeply paraphyletic, confirming that opisthokonts and Amoebozoa independently evolved from sulcozoans by losing their ancestral ventral groove and dorsal pellicle: Apusozoa (apusomonads plus anaerobic breviate amoebae) are robustly sisters to opisthokonts and probably paraphyletic, breviates diverging before apusomonads; Varisulca (planomonads, Mantamonas, and non-gliding flagellate Collodictyon) are sisters to opisthokonts plus Apusozoa and Amoebozoa, and possibly holophyletic; Glissodiscea (planomonads, Mantamonas) may be holophyletic, but Mantamonas sometimes groups with Collodictyon instead. Taxon and gene sampling slightly affects tree topology; for the closest branches in Sulcozoa and opisthokonts, proportionally reducing missing data eliminates conflicts between homogeneous-model maximum-likelihood trees and evolutionarily more realistic site-heterogeneous trees. Sulcozoa, opisthokonts, and Amoebozoa constitute an often-pseudopodial ‘podiate’ clade, one of only three eukaryotic ’supergroups’. Our trees indicate that evolution of sulcozoan dorsal pellicle, ventral pseudopodia, and ciliary gliding (probably simultaneously) generated podiate eukaryotes from Malawimonas-like excavate flagellates.},

  abstract = {Using the basic GenBank local alignment search tool program (BLAST) to identify fungi collected in a recently protected beech forest at Montricher (Switzerland), the number of ITS sequences associated to the wrong taxon name appears to be around 30\%, even higher than previously estimated. Such results rely on the in-depth re-examination of BLAST results for the most interesting species that were collected, viz. first records for Switzerland, rare or patrimonial species and problematic species (when BLAST top scores were equally high for different species), all belonging to Agaricomycotina. This paper dissects for the first time a number of sequence-based identifications, thereby showing in every detail—particularly to the user community of taxonomic information—why sequence-based identification in the context of a fungal inventory can easily go wrong. Our first conclusion is that in-depth examination of BLAST results is too time consuming to be considered as a routine approach for future inventories: we spent two months on verification of approx. 20 identifications. Apart from the fact that poor taxon coverage in public depositories remains the principal impediment for successful species identification, it can be deplored that even very recent fungal sequence deposits in GenBank involve an uncomfortably high number of misidentifications or errors with associated metadata. While checking the original publications associated with top score sequences for the few examples that were here re-examined, a positive consequence is that we uncovered over 80 type sequences that were not annotated as types in GenBank. Advantages and pitfalls of sequence-based identification are discussed, particularly in the light of undertaking fungal inventories. Recommendations are made to avoid or reduce some of the major problems with sequence-based identification. Nevertheless, the prospects for a more reliable sequence-based identification of fungi remain quite dim, unless authors are ready to check and update the metadata associated with previously deposited sequences in their publications.},

The supergroups have withstood phylogenetic hypothesis testing with some modifications, but despite some progress, problematic nodes at the base of the eukaryotic tree still remain to be statistically resolved.

However, at their origin over a billion years ago, fungi, like plants and animals, were unicellular marine microbes. Like the other multicellular kingdoms, Fungi evolved increased size, complexity, and metabolic functioning. Interactions of fungi with plants changed terrestrial ecology and geology and modified the Earth's atmosphere. In this review, we discuss the diversification and ecological roles of the fungi over their first 600 million years, from their origin through their colonization of land, drawing on phylogenomic evidence for their relationships and metabolic capabilities and on molecular dating, fossils, and modeling of Earth's paleoclimate.},

Known primarily from environmental DNA sequences, the group contains few formally described and successfully cultured genera, all known as obligate endoparasites. Numerous studies have detected Cryptomycota as DNA sequences in aquatic, terrestrial, and animal associated habitats, though no study to date has specifically targeted the group by PCR. In this study, we developed Cryptomycota-specific and preferential primers for the 18S rRNA gene in order to facilitate studies on the biodiversity and ecology of the group. The diversity of sequences and habitat association of Cryptomycota was surveyed across three environments: freshwater sediment, marine sediment, and soil. The new primers were able to recover a large proportion of Cryptomycota sequences: of 56 sequences cloned or directly sequenced, 44 were unique OTUs and (39/44) 88.6~\% were phylogenetically affiliated with Cryptomycota. This study expands the boundary of current Cryptomycota sequence diversity; unique Cryptomycota OTUs were spread across six of 12 supported Cryptomycota sub clades. Freshwater sediments and soil were consistently amplified with the Cryptomycota-preferential primers. Our results suggest that Cryptomycota are ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse components of essentially all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, whose ecological functions should be better explored.},

Huhndorf, and Maharachchikumbura and co-authors, took into account phylogenetic evidence. However, even these phylogenetic driven arrangements for Sordariomycetes, were somewhat subjective, as the arrangements in trees depended on many variables, such as number of taxa, different gene regions and methods used in the analyses. What is needed is extra evidence to help standardize ranking in the fungi. Estimation of divergence times using molecular clock methods has been proposed for providing additional rational for higher ranking of taxa. Thus, in Sordariomycetes, a divergence period (i.e. 200–300 MYA) can be used as criteria to judge when a group of related taxa evolved and what rank they should be given. In this paper, we provide an updated classification of accepted subclasses, orders of Sordariomycetes and use divergence times to provide additional evidence to stabilize ranking of taxa in the class. We point out and discuss discrepancies where the phylogenetic tree conflicts with the molecular clock.},

Molecular phylogenies based on one or a few genes did not support the monophyly of the phylum, however, and the phylum was subsequently abandoned. Here we present phylogenetic analyses of a genome-scale data set for 46 taxa, including 25 zygomycetes and 192 proteins, and we demonstrate that zygomycetes comprise two major clades that form a paraphyletic grade. A formal phylogenetic classification is proposed herein and includes two phyla, six subphyla, four classes and 16 orders. On the basis of these results, the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota are circumscribed. Zoopagomycota comprises Entomophtoromycotina, Kickxellomycotina and Zoopagomycotina; it constitutes the earliest diverging lineage of zygomycetes and contains species that are primarily parasites and pathogens of small animals (e.g. amoeba, insects, etc.) and other fungi, i.e. mycoparasites. Mucoromycota comprises Glomeromycotina, Mortierellomycotina, and Mucoromycotina and is sister to Dikarya. It is the more derived clade of zygomycetes and mainly consists of mycorrhizal fungi, root endophytes, and decomposers of plant material. Evolution of trophic modes, morphology, and analysis of genome-scale data are discussed.},

  abstract = {Summary
The Opisthokonta are a eukaryotic supergroup divided in two main lineages: animals and related protistan taxa, and fungi and their allies [1, 2]. There is a great diversity of lifestyles and morphologies among unicellular opisthokonts, from free-living phagotrophic flagellated bacterivores and filopodiated amoebas to cell-walled osmotrophic parasites and saprotrophs. However, these characteristics do not group into monophyletic assemblages, suggesting rampant convergent evolution within Opisthokonta. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a new phylogenomic dataset via sequencing 12 new strains of protists. Phylogenetic relationships among opisthokonts revealed independent origins of filopodiated amoebas in two lineages, one related to fungi and the other to animals. Moreover, we observed that specialized osmotrophic lifestyles evolved independently in fungi and protistan relatives of animals, indicating convergent evolution. We therefore analyzed the evolution of two key fungal characters in Opisthokonta, the flagellum and chitin synthases. Comparative analyses of the flagellar toolkit showed a previously unnoticed flagellar apparatus in two close relatives of animals, the filasterean Ministeria vibrans and Corallochytrium limacisporum. This implies that at least four different opisthokont lineages secondarily underwent flagellar simplification. Analysis of the evolutionary history of chitin synthases revealed significant expansions in both animals and~fungi, and also in the Ichthyosporea and C.~limacisporum, a group of cell-walled animal relatives. This indicates that the last opisthokont common ancestor had a complex toolkit of chitin synthases that was differentially retained in extant lineages. Thus, our data provide evidence for convergent evolution of specialized lifestyles in close relatives of animals and fungi from a generalist ancestor.},

  shorttitle = {Nearly Complete {{rRNA}} Genes from 371 {{Animalia}}},
  abstract = {This study presents a manually constructed alignment of nearly complete rRNA genes from most animal clades (371 taxa from ∼33 of the ∼36 metazoan phyla), expanded from the 197 sequences in a previous study. This thorough, taxon-rich alignment, available at http://www.wsu.edu/\textasciitilde{}jmallatt/research/rRNAalignment.html and in the Dryad Repository (doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1v62kr3q), is based rigidly on the secondary structure of the SSU and LSU rRNA molecules, and is annotated in detail, including labeling of the erroneous sequences (contaminants). The alignment can be used for future studies of the molecular evolution of rRNA. Here, we use it to explore if the larger number of sequences produces an improved phylogenetic tree of animal relationships. Disappointingly, the resolution did not improve, neither when the standard maximum-likelihood method was used, nor with more sophisticated methods that partitioned the rRNA into paired and unpaired sites (stem, loop, bulge, junction), or accounted for the evolution of the paired sites. For example, no doublet model of paired-site substitutions (16-state, 16A and 16B, 7A–F, or 6A–C models) corrected the placement of any rogue taxa or increased resolution. The following findings are from the simplest, standard, ML analysis. The 371-taxon tree only imperfectly supported the bilaterian clades of Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa, and this problem remained after 17 taxa with unstably positioned sequences were omitted from the analysis. The problem seems to stem from base-compositional heterogeneity across taxa and from an overrepresentation of highly divergent sequences among the newly added taxa (e.g., sequences from Cephalopoda, Rotifera, Acoela, and Myxozoa). The rogue taxa continue to concentrate in two locations in the rRNA tree: near the base of Arthropoda and of Bilateria. The approximately uncertain (AU) test refuted the monophyly of Mollusca and of Chordata, probably due to long-branch attraction of the highly divergent cephalopod and urochordate sequences out of those clades. Unlikely to be correct, these refutations show for the first time that rRNA phylogeny can support some ‘wrong’ clades. Along with its weaknesses, the rRNA tree has strengths: It recovers many clades that are supported by independent evidence (e.g., Metazoa, Bilateria, Hexapoda, Nonoculata, Ambulacraria, Syndermata, and Thecostraca with Malacostraca) and shows good resolution within certain groups (e.g., in Platyhelminthes, Insecta, Cnidaria). As another strength, the newly added rRNA sequences yielded the first rRNA-based support for Carnivora and Cetartiodactyla (dolphin+llama) in Mammalia, for basic subdivisions of Bryozoa (‘Gymnolaemata+Stenolaemata’ versus Phylactolaemata), and for Oligostraca (ostracods+branchiurans+pentastomids+mystacocarids). Future improvement could come from better sequence-evolution models that account for base-compositional heterogeneity, and from combining rRNA with protein-coding genes in phylogenetic reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Resolution of the phylogenetic relationships among the major eukaryotic groups is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology that is still only partially solved. This task was initially addressed using a single marker, the small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), although in recent years it has been shown that it does not contain enough phylogenetic information to robustly resolve global eukaryotic phylogeny. This has prompted the use of multi-gene analyses, especially in the form of long concatenations of numerous conserved protein sequences. However, this approach is severely limited by the small number of taxa for which such a large number of protein sequences is available today. We have explored the alternative approach of using only two markers but a large taxonomic sampling, by analysing a combination of SSU and large-subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences. This strategy allows also the incorporation of sequences from non-cultivated protists, e.g., Radiozoa (=radiolaria minus Phaeodarea). We provide the first LSU rRNA sequences for Heliozoa, Apusozoa (both Apusomonadida and Ancyromonadida), Cercozoa and Radiozoa. Our Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses for 91 eukaryotic combined SSU+LSU sequences yielded much stronger support than hitherto for the supergroup Rhizaria (Cercozoa plus Radiozoa plus Foraminifera) and several well-recognised groups and also for other problematic clades, such as the Retaria (Radiozoa plus Foraminifera) and, with more moderate support, the Excavata. Within opisthokonts, the combined tree strongly confirms that the filose amoebae Nuclearia are sisters to Fungi whereas other Choanozoa are sisters to animals. The position of some bikont taxa, notably Heliozoa and Apusozoa, remains unresolved. However, our combined trees suggest a more deeply diverging position for Ancyromonas, and perhaps also Apusomonas, than for other bikonts, suggesting that apusozoan zooflagellates may be central for understanding the early evolution of this huge eukaryotic group. Multiple protein sequences will be needed fully to resolve basal bikont phylogeny. Nonetheless, our results suggest that combined SSU+LSU rDNA phylogenies can help to resolve several ambiguous regions of the eukaryotic tree and identify key taxa for subsequent multi-gene analyses.},

However, the reference databases of full-length SSU rRNA gene sequences are skewed to well-studied ecosystems and subject to primer bias and chimerism, which results in an incomplete view of the diversity present in a sample. We combine poly(A)-tailing and reverse transcription of SSU rRNA molecules with synthetic long-read sequencing to generate high-quality, full-length SSU rRNA sequences, without primer bias, at high throughput. We apply our approach to samples from seven different ecosystems and obtain more than a million SSU rRNA sequences from all domains of life, with an estimated raw error rate of 0.17\%. We observe a large proportion of novel diversity, including several deeply branching phylum-level lineages putatively related to the Asgard Archaea. Our approach will enable expansion of the SSU rRNA reference databases by orders of magnitude, and contribute to a comprehensive census of the tree of life.},

Although this genus was established 130 years ago, crucial questions on the phylogenetic relationships and biology of this enigmatic taxon are still unanswered. In order to infer a robust hypothesis about the phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and to evaluate evolutionary trends, multiple gene sequences and morphological characteristics of Entorrhiza were analyzed and compared with respective findings in Fungi. In our comprehensive five-gene analyses Entorrhiza appeared as a highly supported monophyletic lineage representing the sister group to the rest of the Dikarya, a phylogenetic placement that received but moderate maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony bootstrap support. An alternative maximum likelihood tree with the constraint that Entorrhiza forms a monophyletic group with Basidiomycota could not be rejected. According to the first phylogenetic hypothesis, the teliospore tetrads of Entorrhiza represent the prototype of the dikaryan meiosporangium. The alternative hypothesis is supported by similarities in septal pore structure, cell wall and spindle pole bodies. Based on the isolated phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and its peculiar combination of features related to ultrastructure and reproduction mode, we propose a new phylum Entorrhizomycota, for the genus Entorrhiza, which represents an apparently widespread group of inconspicuous fungi.},

  abstract = {The recent introduction of molecular techniques in eukaryotic microbial diversity studies, in particular those based in the amplification and sequencing of small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), has revealed the existence of an unexpected variety of new phylotypes. The taxonomic ascription of the organisms bearing those sequences is generally deduced from phylogenetic analysis. Unfortunately, the SSU rDNA sequence alone has often not enough phylogenetic information to resolve the phylogeny of fast-evolving or very divergent sequences, leading to their misclassification. To address this problem, we tried to increase the phylogenetic signal by amplifying the complete eukaryotic rDNA cluster [i.e. the SSU rDNA, the internal transcribed spacers, the 5.8S rDNA and the large-subunit (LSU) rDNA] from environmental samples, and sequencing the SSU and LSU rDNA part of the clones. Using marine planktonic samples, we showed that surveys based on either SSU or SSU + LSU rDNA retrieved comparable diversity patterns. In addition, phylogenetic trees based on the concatenated SSU + LSU rDNA sequences showed better resolution, yielding good support for major eukaryotic groups such as the Opisthokonta, Rhizaria and Excavata. Finally, highly divergent SSU rDNA sequences, whose phylogenetic position was impossible to determine with the SSU rDNA data alone, could be placed correctly with the SSU + LSU rDNA approach. These results suggest that this method can be useful, in particular for the analysis of eukaryotic microbial communities rich in phylotypes of difficult phylogenetic ascription.},

To rectify this we sequenced cDNA libraries for seven diverse Amoebozoa and conducted phylogenetic analyses for 109 eukaryotes (17–18 Amoebozoa) using 60–188 genes. We conducted Bayesian inferences with the evolutionarily most realistic site-heterogeneous CAT-GTR-Γ model and maximum likelihood analyses. These unequivocally establish the monophyly of Amoebozoa, showing a primary dichotomy between the previously contested subphyla Lobosa and Conosa. Lobosa, the entirely non-flagellate lobose amoebae, are robustly partitioned into the monophyletic classes Tubulinea, with predominantly tube-shaped pseudopodia, and Discosea with flattened cells and different locomotion. Within Conosa 60/70-gene trees with very little missing data show a primary dichotomy between the aerobic infraphylum Semiconosia (Mycetozoa and Variosea) and secondarily anaerobic Archamoebae. These phylogenetic features are entirely congruent with the most recent major amoebozoan classification emphasising locomotion modes, pseudopodial morphology, and ultrastructure. However, 188-gene trees where proportionally more taxa have sparser gene-representation weakly place Archamoebae as sister to Macromycetozoa instead, possibly a tree reconstruction artefact of differentially missing data.},

Phylogenomic analyses have shed light on the evolutionary relationships within and between supergroups as well as placed newly sequenced enigmatic species close to known lineages. Yet, a few eukaryote species remain of unknown origin and could represent key evolutionary forms for inferring ancient genomic and cellular characteristics of eukaryotes. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origin of the poorly studied protist Collodictyon (subphylum Diphyllatia) by sequencing a cDNA library as well as the 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes. Phylogenomic trees inferred from 124 genes placed Collodictyon close to the bifurcation of the “unikont” and “bikont” groups, either alone or as sister to the potentially contentious excavate Malawimonas. Phylogenies based on rDNA genes confirmed that Collodictyon is closely related to another genus, Diphylleia, and revealed a very low diversity in environmental DNA samples. The early and distinct origin of Collodictyon suggests that it constitutes a new lineage in the global eukaryote phylogeny. Collodictyon shares cellular characteristics with Excavata and Amoebozoa, such as ventral feeding groove supported by microtubular structures and the ability to form thin and broad pseudopods. These may therefore be ancient morphological features among eukaryotes. Overall, this shows that Collodictyon is a key lineage to understand early eukaryote evolution.},

  abstract = {BackgroundOne of the most crucial steps in high-throughput sequence-based microbiome studies is the taxonomic assignment of sequences belonging to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Without taxonomic classification, functional and biological information of microbial communities cannot be inferred or interpreted. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA is the conventional marker region for fungal community studies. While bioinformatics pipelines that cluster reads into OTUs have received much attention in the literature, less attention has been given to the taxonomic classification of these sequences, upon which biological inference is dependent.ResultsHere we compare how three common fungal OTU taxonomic assignment tools (RDP Classifier, UTAX, and SINTAX) handle ITS fungal sequence data. The classification power, defined as the proportion of assigned OTUs at a given taxonomic rank, varied among the classifiers. Classifiers were generally consistent (assignment of the same taxonomy to a given OTU) across datasets and ranks; a small number of OTUs were assigned unique classifications across programs. We developed CONSTAX (CONSensus TAXonomy), a Python tool that compares taxonomic classifications of the three programs and merges them into an improved consensus taxonomy. This tool also produces summary classification outputs that are useful for downstream analyses.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that independent taxonomy assignment tools classify unique members of the fungal community, and greater classification power is realized by generating consensus taxonomy of available classifiers with CONSTAX.},

However, the different components needs to be distinct from each other to be interpretable otherwise they only represents random directions. This is a fundamental assumption of PCA and thus needs to be tested every time. Sample correlation matrices will always result in a pattern of decreasing eigenvalues even if there is no structure. Tests are therefore needed to discern real patterns from illusionary ones. Furthermore,, the loadings of the vectors need to be larger than expected by random data to be useful in the calculation of PC-scores. PC-scores calculated from non-distinct PC's have very large standard errors and cannot be used for biological interpretations. I give a number of examples to illustrate the potential problems with PCA. Robustness of the PC's increases with increasing sample size, but not the number of traits. I review a few simple test statistics appropriate for testing PC's, and use a real world example to illustrate how this can be done using randomization tests. PCA can be very useful but great care is needed to avoid spurious results. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

As part of a project funded in the Netherlands to barcode specimens of major national biobanks, sequences of two nuclear ribosomal genetic markers, the Internal Transcribed Spaces and 5.8S gene (ITS) and the D1/D2 domain of the 26S Large Subunit (LSU), were generated as DNA barcode data for ca. 100\hphantom{,}000 fungal strains originally assigned to ca. 17\hphantom{,}000 species in the CBS fungal biobank maintained at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Utrecht. Using more than 24\hphantom{,}000 DNA barcode sequences of 12\hphantom{,}000 ex-type and manually validated filamentous fungal strains of 7\hphantom{,}300 accepted species, the optimal identity thresholds to discriminate filamentous fungal species were predicted as 99.6~\% for ITS and 99.8~\% for LSU. We showed that 17~\% and 18~\% of the species could not be discriminated by the ITS and LSU genetic markers, respectively. Among them, ∼8~\% were indistinguishable using both genetic markers. ITS has been shown to outperform LSU in filamentous fungal species discrimination with a probability of correct identification of 82~\% vs. 77.6~\%, and a clustering quality value of 84~\% vs. 77.7~\%. At higher taxonomic classifications, LSU has been shown to have a better discriminatory power than ITS. With a clustering quality value of 80~\%, LSU outperformed ITS in identifying filamentous fungi at the ordinal level. At the generic level, the clustering quality values produced by both genetic markers were low, indicating the necessity for taxonomic revisions at genus level and, likely, for applying more conserved genetic markers or even whole genomes. The taxonomic thresholds predicted for filamentous fungal identification at the genus, family, order and class levels were 94.3~\%, 88.5~\%, 81.2~\% and 80.9~\% based on ITS barcodes, and 98.2~\%, 96.2~\%, 94.7~\% and 92.7~\% based on LSU barcodes. The DNA barcodes used in this study have been deposited to GenBank and will also be publicly available at the Westerdijk Institute's website as reference sequences for fungal identification, marking an unprecedented data release event in global fungal barcoding efforts to date.},

Sequences of two loci, ITS and LSU, were generated as barcode data for all (ca. 9k) yeast strains included in the CBS collection, originally assigned to ca. 2\hphantom{,}000 species. Taxonomic sequence validation turned out to be the most severe bottleneck due to the large volume of generated trace files and lack of reference sequences. We have analysed and validated CBS strains and barcode sequences automatically. Our analysis shows that there were 6 and 9.5~\% of CBS yeast species that could not be distinguished by ITS and LSU, respectively. Among them, ∼3~\% were indistinguishable by both loci. Except for those species, both loci were successfully resolving yeast species as the grouping of yeast DNA barcodes with the predicted taxonomic thresholds was more than 90~\% similar to the grouping with respect to the expected taxon names. The taxonomic thresholds predicted to discriminate yeast species were 98.41~\% for ITS and 99.51~\% for LSU. To discriminate current yeast genera, thresholds were 96.31~\% for ITS and 97.11~\% for LSU. Using ITS and LSU barcodes, we were also able to show that the recent reclassifications of basidiomycetous yeasts in 2015 have made a significant improvement for the generic taxonomy of those organisms. The barcodes of 4\hphantom{,}730 (51~\%) CBS yeast strains of 1\hphantom{,}351 (80~\%) accepted yeast species that were manually validated have been released to GenBank and the CBS-KNAW website as reference sequences for yeast identification.},

In this paper a theory is developed that applies current views of protein gene evolution to the ribosomal RNAs. The major topics addressed are the variability in size, gene arrangement, and processing of the rRNAs among the three primary lines of descent. Among the conclusions are that the rRNAs of eukaryotes retain some primitive features that were probably present in the rRNAs of the earliest cell (the progenote) and that the genes coding for the three major rRNA species were probably originally unlinked.},

  abstract = {Integration of fungal evolution with the dates of plate tectonic movements, paleoecology, and the evolution of plants and animals requires a molecular clock. Imperfect though they may be, molecular clocks provide the means to convert molecular change into geological time. The relationships among clocks, phylogeography, fossils, and substitution rate variation, along with incorporation of uncertainty into clock estimates are the topics for this commentary. This commentary is timely because, for deeper divergences on the order of hundreds of millions of years, estimates of age of origin are benefiting from increasingly accurate organismal phylogenies and increasingly realistic models of molecular evolution. Taking advantage of Bayesian approaches permitting complex assumptions about node ages and molecular evolution, we used the program BEAST to apply a relaxed lognormal clock analysis to a data set comprising 50 loci for 26 taxa. In the resulting tree, branches associated with nodes calibrated by fossils showed more dramatic substitution rate variation than branches at nodes lacking calibration. As a logical extension of this result, we suspect that undetected rate variation in the uncalibrated parts of the tree is as dramatic as in the calibrated sections, underscoring the importance of fossil calibration. Fortunately, new and interesting fungal fossils are being discovered and we review some of the new discoveries that confirm the ancient origin of important taxa. To help evaluate which fossils might be useful for constraining the ages of nodes, we selected fossils thought to be early members of their clades and used ribosomal or protein-coding gene sequence substitution rates to calculate whether fossil age and expected lineage age coincide. Where ages of a fossil and the expected age of a lineage do coincide, the fossils will be particularly useful in constraining node ages in molecular clock analyses.},

  abstract = {Background VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.},

  abstract = {This revision of the classification of eukaryotes follows that of Adl et al., 2012 [J. Euk. Microbiol. 59(5)] and retains an emphasis on protists. Changes since have improved the resolution of many nodes in phylogenetic analyses. For some clades even families are being clearly resolved. As we had predicted, environmental sampling in the intervening years has massively increased the genetic information at hand. Consequently, we have discovered novel clades, exciting new genera and uncovered a massive species level diversity beyond the morphological species descriptions. Several clades known from environmental samples only have now found their home. Sampling soils, deeper marine waters and the deep sea will continue to fill us with surprises. The main changes in this revision are the confirmation that eukaryotes form at least two domains, the loss of monophyly in the Excavata, robust support for the Haptista and Cryptista. We provide suggested primer sets for DNA sequences from environmental samples that are effective for each clade. We have provided a guide to trophic functional guilds in an appendix, to facilitate the interpretation of environmental samples, and a standardized taxonomic guide for East Asian users.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Much of the ecological, taxonomic and biodiversity research relies on understanding of phylogenetic relationships among organisms. There are multiple available classification systems that all suffer from differences in naming, incompleteness, presence of multiple non-monophyletic entities and poor correspondence of divergence times. These issues render taxonomic comparisons across the main groups of eukaryotes and all life in general difficult at best. By using the monophyly criterion, roughly comparable time of divergence and information from multiple phylogenetic reconstructions, I propose an alternative classification system for the domain Eukarya to improve hierarchical taxonomical comparability for animals, plants, fungi and multiple protist groups. Following this rationale, I propose 32 kingdoms of eukaryotes that are treated in 10 subdomains. These kingdoms are further separated into 43, 115, 140 and 353 taxa at the level of subkingdom, phylum, subphylum and class, respectively (http://dx.doi.org/10.15156/BIO/587483). Most of the names have been used previously or these were deduced from those of the type taxa to be able to unambiguously link genera to higher taxonomic levels. In the era of phylogenomics, understanding about the phylogenetic relationships among organisms is rapidly increasing. Classifications systems must keep pace with this race to serve the research community by consistent improvements in precision in terms of taxonomic resolution and maintaining monophyly of the ingredient taxa.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of sequence similarities that are sufficient to establish homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities, and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them, evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived, and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a previously published set of 3,332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K, Rose D, Stadler PF (2005) Noncoding RNAs in Ciona intestinalis. Bioinformatics 21 (Supplement 2): i77–i78). In addition to recovering, e.g., tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for which to date no representative has been experimentally characterized.},

  abstract = {Current genomic screens for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) predict a large number of genomic regions containing potential structural ncRNAs. The analysis of these data requires highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak predictions. Existing methods struggle with these goals because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence alignments, which regularly misalign RNA structure and therefore do not support identification of structural similarities. To overcome this limitation, we compute columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on sequence and structure similarity; we refer to these structure-based alignment reliabilities as STARs. The columnwise STARs of alignments, or STAR profiles, provide a versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of ncRNAs. In particular, we improve the boundary prediction of the widely used ncRNA gene finder RNAz by a factor of 3 from a median deviation of 47 to 13 nt. Post-processing RNAz predictions, LocARNA-P's STAR score allows much stronger discrimination between true- and false-positive predictions than RNAz's own evaluation. The improved accuracy, in this scenario increased from AUC 0.71 to AUC 0.87, significantly reduces the cost of successive analysis steps. The ready-to-use software tool LocARNA-P produces structure-based multiple RNA alignments with associated columnwise STARs and predicts ncRNA boundaries. We provide additional results, a web server for LocARNA/LocARNA-P, and the software package, including documentation and a pipeline for refining screens for structural ncRNA, at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Supplements/LocARNA-P/.},

  abstract = {Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole-genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, however, is limited, due to their reliance on sequence-based whole-genome aligners, which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for genome-wide screens due to its extreme computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for Prediction of structural ncRNA), which efficiently realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and structure, thus allowing us to boost the performance of de novo ncRNA predictors, such as RNAz. Key to the pipeline's efficiency is the development of a novel banding technique for multiple RNA alignment. REAPR significantly outperforms the widely used predictors RNAz and EvoFold in genome-wide screens; in direct comparison to the most recent RNAz screen on D. melanogaster, REAPR predicts twice as many high-confidence ncRNA candidates. Moreover, modENCODE RNA-seq experiments confirm a substantial number of its predictions as transcripts. REAPR's advancement of de novo structural characterization of ncRNAs complements the identification of transcripts from rapidly accumulating RNA-seq data.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic bootstrapping (BS) is a standard technique for inferring confidence values on phylogenetic trees that is based on reconstructing many trees from minor variations of the input data, trees called replicates. BS is used with all phylogenetic reconstruction approaches, but we focus here on one of the most popular, maximum likelihood (ML). Because ML inference is so computationally demanding, it has proved too expensive to date to assess the impact of the number of replicates used in BS on the relative accuracy of the support values. For the same reason, a rather small number (typically 100) of BS replicates are computed in real-world studies. Stamatakis et al. recently introduced a BS algorithm that is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, while yielding qualitatively comparable support values, making an experimental study possible. In this article, we propose stopping criteria—that is, thresholds computed at runtime to determine when enough replicates have been generated—and we report on the first large-scale experimental study to assess the effect of the number of replicates on the quality of support values, including the performance of our proposed criteria. We run our tests on 17 diverse real-world DNA—single-gene as well as multi-gene—datasets, which include 125–2,554 taxa. We find that our stopping criteria typically stop computations after 100–500 replicates (although the most conservative criterion may continue for several thousand replicates) while producing support values that correlate at better than 99.5\% with the reference values on the best ML trees. Significantly, we also find that the stopping criteria can recommend very different numbers of replicates for different datasets of comparable sizes. Our results are thus twofold: (i) they give the first experimental assessment of the effect of the number of BS replicates on the quality of support values returned through BS, and (ii) they validate our proposals for stopping criteria. Practitioners will no longer have to enter a guess nor worry about the quality of support values; moreover, with most counts of replicates in the 100–500 range, robust BS under ML inference becomes computationally practical for most datasets. The complete test suite is available at http://lcbb.epfl.ch/BS.tar.bz2, and BS with our stopping criteria is included in the latest release of RAxML v7.2.5, available at http://wwwkramer.in.tum.de/exelixis/software.html.},

At these annealing temperatures, all ascomycetous DNA samples were amplified efficiently with the ITS4A primer. The sensitivity limit was in the range 10−14 g of DNA.

Both taxa are replete with rDNA spliceosomal introns and autocatalytic group I introns, many of which show presence/absence polymorphism when screened with the PCR approach. This initially suggested that Physcia could be a model for studying intron retention and loss. However, during the course of a population-level analysis, we discovered widespread intron presence/absence heterogeneity within lichen thalli. To address this result, we sequenced multiple clones encoding nuclear rDNA and the single-copy elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) from individual thalli. These data showed extensive rDNA heterogeneity within individuals, rather than the presence of multiple fungi within a thallus. Our results suggest that considerable care must be taken when interpreting intron presence/absence in lichen rDNA, an observation that has general implications for the study of rDNA intron evolution.},

  abstract = {We reassessed the circumscription of the cantharelloid clade and identified monophyletic groups by using nLSU, nSSU, mtSSU and RPB2 sequence data. Results agreed with earlier studies that placed the genera Cantharellus, Craterellus, Hydnum, Clavulina, Membranomyces, Multiclavula, Sistotrema, Botryobasidium and the family Ceratobasidiaceae in that clade. Phylogenetic analyses support monophyly of all genera except Sistotrema, which was highly polyphyletic. Strongly supported monophyletic groups were: (i) Cantharellus-Craterellus, Hydnum, and the Sistotrema confluens group; (ii) Clavulina-Membranomyces and the S. brinkmannii-oblongisporum group, with Multiclavula being possibly sister of that clade; (iii) the Sistotrema eximum-octosporum group; (iv) Sistotrema adnatum and S. coronilla. Positions of Sistotrema raduloides and S. athelioides were unresolved, as were basal relationships. Botryobasidium was well supported as the sister taxon of all the above taxa, while Ceratobasidiaceae was the most basal lineage. The relationship between Tulasnella and members of the cantharelloid clade will require further scrutiny, although there is cumulative evidence that they are probably sister groups. The rates of molecular evolution of both the large and small nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (nuc-rDNA) are much higher in Cantharellus, Craterellus and Tulasnella than in the other cantharelloid taxa, and analyses of nuc-rDNA sequences strongly placed Tulasnella close to Cantharellus-Craterellus. In contrast analyses with RPB2 and mtSSU sequences placed Tulasnella at the base of the cantharelloid clade. Our attempt to reconstruct a “supertree” from tree topologies resulting from separate analyses that avoided phylogenetic reconstruction problems associated with missing data and/or unalignable sequences proved unsuccessful.},

Because there have been no molecular phylogenetic studies of the Russulales, attempts at formulating a natural classification for these taxa have met with difficulty. In this study, nuclear large subunit rDNA (n-LSU) was used to infer phylogenetic relationships among members of the Russulales including agaricoid, tropical pleurotoid and annulate taxa, and gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid genera. Analysis of the n-LSU region indicated that Russula sensu strictu (excluding gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid taxa) can be considered polyphyletic with two well supported groups, one group arising separately from the main body of the tree and one group basal to Lactarius. Russula sensu lato can be considered paraphyletic with gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid forms nested in the same clades alongside agaricoid taxa. Lactarius sensu lato was found to be a monophyletic group that includes agaricoid, gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid taxa. Gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid genera were scattered throughout the order, with Macowanites, Gymnomyces, Cystangium and Martellia nested within Russula, while Zelleromyces and Arcangeliella grouped within Lactarius. Most of the gasteroid and hypogeous gasteroid genera appear to be polyphyletic and their position was supported within established infrageneric taxa of Russula and Lactarius. These results suggested that synonomy of gasteroid genera into Russula and Lactarius is justifiable.},

The species is morphologically distinctive in forming densely woven, semicircular thalli, closely resembling those of the paleotropical D. liguuxtum but lacking clamps and with hyphal sheath around the photobiont filaments that resembles those of Cyphellostereum species. The species was reported to have hallucinogenic properties and chemical analyses suggest certain substances present that are shared with the hallucinogenic mushroom Psilocybe cubensis. Due to our inability to use pure reference compounds and scarce amount of sample for compound identification, however, our analyses were not able to determine conclusively the presence of hallucinogenic substances.},

  abstract = {Bdelloid rotifers are important contributors to biogeochemical cycling and trophic dynamics of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but little is known about their biogeographic distribution and community structure in terrestrial environments. This lack of knowledge stems from a lack of phylogenetic information and assumptions that microbial eukaryotes are globally distributed and have very limited diversity across vast geographic distances. However, these assumptions have been based more on assessments of their morphology than any measure of their true genetic diversity and biogeographic distribution. We developed specific primers for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene of bdelloid rotifers and amplified and cloned sequences using a nested sampling scheme that represented local (0–10 m) to global (up to 10,000 km) scales. Using phylogenetic community analyses (UniFrac) and geospatial statistics (semivariograms, mantel tests), we were able to reject the hypothesis that communities of rotifers are the same across even fairly small geographic distances. Bdelloid communities showed highly significant spatial structuring with spatial autocorrelation ranges of 54–133 m, but beyond that distance communities were extremely dissimilar. Furthermore, we show that these spatial patterns are driven not only by changes in relative abundance of phylotypes but also by absolute changes in phylotype occurrence (richness). There is almost no overlap in phylotype [or operational taxonomic unit (OTU)] occurrence between communities at distances beyond the autocorrelation range (\textasciitilde{}133 m). Such small species ranges, combined with their ubiquity in soils, make it increasingly clear that the biodiversity of bdelloid rotifers (and other less easily dispersed microbes) is much higher than previously thought.},
